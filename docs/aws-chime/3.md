# Using the Amazon Chime SDK

You use the Amazon Chime SDK to build real-time media applications that can send and receive audio and video and allow content sharing.
The Amazon Chime SDK works independently of any Amazon Chime administrator accounts, and it does not affect meetings hosted on Amazon Chime. 
Instead, the Amazon Chime SDK provides builder tools that you use to build your own meeting applications.
