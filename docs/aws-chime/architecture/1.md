# Meetings and attendees

When the server application creates an Amazon Chime SDK meeting, the meeting is assigned to a region-specific media service. The hosts in the service are responsible for securely transferring real-time media between attendee clients. Each created attendee is assigned a unique join token, an opaque secret key that your server application must securely transfer to the client authorized to join the meeting on behalf of an attendee. Each client uses a join token to authenticate with the media service group. Clients use a combination of secure WebSockets and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) to securely signal the media service group, and to send and receive media to and from other attendees through the media service group.
