# Audio
The media service mixes audio together from each attendee and sends the mix to each recipient, after subtracting their own audio from the mix. The Amazon Chime SDKs sample audio at the highest rate supported by the device and browser, up to a maximum of 48kHz. We use the Opus codec to encode audio, with a default bitrate of 32kbps, which can be increased to up to 128kbps stereo and 64kbps mono.
