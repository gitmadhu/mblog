` Colm O’Shea`
### Knowing When It’s Raining

When I asked Colm O’Shea to recall mistakes that were learning experiences, he struggled to come up with an example. At last, the best he was able to do was describe a trade that was a missed profit opportunity. It is not that O’Shea doesn’t make mistakes. He makes lots of them. As he freely acknowledges, he is wrong on at least 50 percent of his trades. However, he never lets a mistake get remotely close to the point where it would provide a good story. Large trading losses are simply incompatible with his methodology.

O’Shea is a global macro trader—a strategy style that seeks to profit from correctly anticipating directional trends in global currency, interest rate, equity and commodity markets. At surface consideration, a strategy that requires participating in directional moves in major global markets may not sound like it would be well suited to maintaining tightly constrained losses, but the way O’Shea trades, it is. O’Shea views his trading ideas as hypotheses. A market move counter to the expected direction is proof that his hypothesis for that trade is wrong, and O’Shea then has no reluctance in liquidating the position. O’Shea defines the price point that would invalidate his hypothesis before he places a trade. He sizes his position so that the loss from a move to that price level is limited to a small percentage of assets. Hence, the lack of any good war stories of trades gone awry.

O’Shea’s interest in politics came first, economics second, and markets third. His early teen years coincided with the advent of Thatcherism and the national debate over reducing the government’s role in the economy—a conflict that sparked O’Shea’s interest in politics and soon after economics. O’Shea educated himself so well in economics that he was able to land a job as an economist for a consulting firm before he began university. The firm had an abrupt opening for an economist position because of the unexpected departure of an employee. At one point in his interview for the position, he was asked to explain the seeming paradox of the Keynesian multiplier. The interviewer asked, “How does taking money from people by selling bonds and giving that same amount of money back to people through fiscal spending create stimulus?” O’Shea replied, “That is a really good question. I never thought about it.” Apparently, the firm liked that he was willing to admit what he did not know rather than trying to bluff his way through, and he was hired.

O’Shea had picked up a good working knowledge of econometrics through independent reading, so the firm made him the economist for the Belgian economy. He was sufficiently well prepared to be able to use the firm’s econometric models to derive forecasts. O’Shea, however, was kept behind closed doors. He was not allowed to speak to any clients. The firm couldn’t exactly acknowledge that a 19-year-old was generating the forecasts and writing the reports. But they were happy to let O’Shea do the whole task with just enough supervision to make sure he didn’t mess up.

At the time, the general consensus among economists was that the outlook for Belgium was negative. But after he had gone through the data and done his own modeling, O’Shea came to the conclusion that the growth outlook for Belgium was actually pretty good. He wanted to come up with a forecast that was at least 2 percent higher than the forecast of any other economist. “You can’t do that,” he was told. “This is not how things work. We will allow you to have one of the highest forecasts, and if growth is really strong as you expect, we will still be right by having a forecast near the high end of the range. There is nothing to be gained by having a forecast outside the range, in which case if you are wrong, we would look ridiculous.” As it turned out, O’Shea’s forecast turned out to be right, but no one cared.

His one-year stint as an economist before he attended university taught O’Shea one important lesson: He did not want to be an economic consultant. “As an economic consultant,” he says, “how you package your work is more important than what you have actually done. There is massive herding in economic forecasting. By staying near the benchmark or the prevailing range, you get all the upside of being right without the downside. Once I understood the rules of the game, I became quite cynical about it.”

After graduating from Cambridge in 1992, O’Shea landed a job as a trader for Citigroup. He was profitable every year, and his trading line and responsibilities steadily increased. By the time O’Shea left Citigroup in 2003 to become a portfolio manager for Soros’s Quantum Fund, he was trading an exposure level equivalent to a multibillion-dollar hedge fund. After two successful years at Soros, O’Shea left to become a global macro strategy manager for the multimanager fund at Balyasny, a portfolio that was to be the precursor for his own hedge fund, COMAC, formed two years later.

O’Shea has never had a losing year. The majority of his track record, spanning his years at Citigroup and Soros, is not available for public disclosure, so no precise statements about performance can be made. The only portion of this track record that is available is for the period at Balyasny, which began in December 2004, and his current hedge fund portfolio, which launched in June 2006. For the combined period, as of end of 2011, the average annual compounded net return was 11.3 percent with an annualized volatility of 8.1 percent and a worst monthly loss of 3.7 percent. If your first thought as you read this is “only 11.3 percent,” a digression into performance evaluation is necessary.

Return is a function of both skill (in selecting, implementing, and liquidating trades) and the degree of risk taken. Doubling the risk will double the return. In this light, the true measure of performance is return/risk, not return. This performance evaluation perspective is especially true for global macro, a strategy in which only a fraction of assets under management are typically required to establish and maintain portfolio positions.1 Thus, if desired, a global macro manager could increase exposure by many multiples with existing assets under management (i.e., without any borrowing). The choice of exposure will drive the level of both returns and risk. O’Shea has chosen to run his fund at a relatively low risk level. Whether measured by volatility (8.2 percent), worst monthly loss (3.7 percent), or maximum drawdown (10.2 percent), his risk metrics are about half that of the average for global macro managers. If run at an exposure level more in line with the majority of global macro managers, or equivalently, at a volatility level equal to the S&P 500, the average annual compounded net return on O’Shea’s fund would have been about 23 percent. Alternatively, if O’Shea had still been managing the portfolio as a proprietary account, an account type in which exposure is run at a much higher level relative to assets, the returns would have been many times higher for the exact same trading results. These discrepancies disappear if performance is measured in return/risk terms, which is invariant to the exposure level. O’Shea’s Gain to Pain ratio (a return/risk measure detailed in Appendix A) is a strong 1.76.

I interviewed O’Shea in London on the day of the royal wedding. Because of related street closures, we met at a club at which O’Shea was a member, instead of at his office. O’Shea explained that he had chosen to join this particular club because they had an informal dress code. We conducted the interview in the club’s drawing room, a pleasant space, which fortunately was sparsely populated, presumably because most people were watching the wedding. O’Shea spoke enthusiastically as he expressed his views on economics, markets, and trading. At one point in our conversation, a man came over and asked O’Shea if he could speak more quietly as his voice was disrupting the tranquility of the room. O’Shea apologized and subsequently dropped his voice level to library standards. Since I was recording the conversation, as I do for all interviews—I am such a poor note taker that I don’t even make the attempt—I became paranoid that the recorder might not clearly pick up the now softly speaking O’Shea. My concerns were heightened anytime there was an increase in background noise, which included other conversations, piped-in music, and the occasional disruptive barking of some dogs one of the members had brought with him. I finally asked O’Shea to raise his voice to some compromise level between his natural speech and the subdued tone he had assumed. The member with the barking dogs finally left, and as he passed us, I was surprised to see—although I really shouldn’t have been—that it was the same man who had complained to O’Shea that he was speaking too loudly.



When did you first become interested in markets?

It was one of those incredible chance occurrences. When I was 17, I was backpacking across Europe. I was in Rome and had run out of books to read. I went to a local open market where there was a book vendor, and, literally, the only book they had in English was Reminiscences of a Stock Operator. It was an old, tattered copy. I still have it. It’s the only possession in the world that I care about. The book was amazing. It brought everything in my life together.

What hooked you?

What hooked me early about macro was . . .

No, I meant what hooked you about the book? The book has nothing to do with macro.

I disagree. It’s all there. It starts off with the protagonist just reading the tape, but that isn’t what he developed into. Everyone gives him tips, but the character Mr. Partridge tells him all that matters, “It’s a bull market.”2

That’s a fundamental macro person. Partridge teaches him that there is a much bigger picture. It’s not just random noise making the numbers go up and down. There is something else going on that makes it a bull or bear market. As the book’s narrator goes through his career, he becomes increasingly fundamental. He starts talking about demand and supply, which is what global macro is all about.

People get all excited about the price movements, but they completely misunderstand that there is a bigger picture in which those price movements happen. Price movements only have meaning in the context of the fundamental landscape. To use a sailing analogy, the wind matters, but the tide matters, too. If you don’t know what the tide is, and you plan everything just based on the wind, you are going to end up crashing into the rocks. That is how I see fundamentals and technicals. You need to pay attention to both to make sense of the picture.

Reminiscences is a brilliant book about the journey. The narrator starts out with an interest in watching numbers go up and down. I started out with an interest in politics and economics. But we both end up in a place that is not that far apart. You need to develop your own market experience. You are only going to fully understand what the traders in your books were saying after you have done it yourself. Then you realize, “Oh, that’s what they meant.” It seems really obvious. But before you experience it and learn it, it’s hard to understand.

What was the next step in your journey to becoming a trader after reading Reminiscences?

I went to Cambridge to study economics. I knew I wanted to study economics from the age of 12, well before my interest in markets. I wanted to do it because I loved economics, not because I thought that was a pathway to the markets. Too many people do things for other reasons.

What did you learn in college about economics that was important?

I was very lucky that I went to college when I did. If I went now, I think I would be really disappointed because the way economics is currently taught is terrible.

Tell me what you mean by that.

When I went to university, economics was taught more like philosophy than engineering. Since then, economics has become all about mathematical rigor and modeling. The thing about mathematical modeling is that in order to make problems tractable, you need to make assumptions. Assumptions then become axiomatic for the entire subject—not because they are true, but because they are necessary to get a solution. So, it is easier to assume efficient markets because without that assumption, you can’t do the math. The problem is that markets aren’t efficient, but that fact is just conveniently ignored.

And the mathematical models can’t include the unpredictable impact of speculators, either.

That’s right. Because once you introduce them, you have a mathematical model that can’t be solved. In the current world of economics, mathematical rigor is valued above all else. It’s the only way you will get your PhD; it’s the only way you will get a career in academia; it’s the only way you will get tenure. As a consequence, anyone I would call an economist has been moved out of the economics department and into history, political science, or sociology. The mathematization of economics has been a disaster because it has greatly narrowed the scope of the field.

Do you have a favorite economist?

Keynes. It’s a shame that Keynesianism in the United States has become this weird word whose meaning is barely recognizable.

That’s because in the United States, people apply the word Keynesianism to refer to deficit spending, regardless of whether it occurs in an economic expansion or contraction.

That’s not what he said.

I know that. Although he certainly would have favored deficit spending in 2008 and 2009, he would have had a very different perspective about deficit spending in the expanding economy that prevailed in previous years.

Yes, Keynes was a fiscal conservative.

I’m curious as to your views regarding the critical dilemma that currently faces the United States. On one hand, if deficits are allowed to go on, it could well lead to a catastrophic outcome. On the other hand, if you begin substantially cutting spending with current unemployment still very high, it could trigger a severe economic contraction, leading to lower revenues and upward pressure on the deficit.

The argument for fiscal stimulus is a perfectly coherent, logical case. The counterargument that we should cut spending now is also a perfectly rational case. But both sides are often expressed in totally irrational ways. I think the biggest mistake people make is to assume there is an answer when, in fact, there may not be a good answer.

I actually had the same perception after the 2008 presidential election. I thought the economy had been so mismanaged between the combination of exploding debt and a postbubble collapse in economic activity that there might not be any solution. The American humor newspaper, the Onion, captured the situation perfectly. Their headline after Obama was elected was, “Black Man Given Nation’s Worst Job.”

All solutions that will work in the real world have to embrace the fact that the U.S. is not as rich as Americans think it is. Most political solutions will be in denial of that fact. The relevant question is: Which difficult choice do you want to make?

Did you know what you wanted to do when you were in university?

Yes, become a trader. Although looking back at it, at the time, I didn’t quite know what that meant.

What was your first job after graduating?

I got a job as a junior trader at Citigroup in the foreign exchange department. My first week at work was the week when the pound was kicked out of the ERM.

The Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), which was operative in the decades prior to the implementation of the euro, linked the exchange rates of European currencies within defined price bands. The U.K. was forced to withdraw from the ERM in 1992 when the pound declined below the low end of its band.

The week when George Soros in the popular vernacular “broke the Bank of England”?

Yes. As you may know, I worked for George Soros before starting my own fund. My favorite George Soros story concerns an interview with Chancellor Norman Lamont, who stated that the Bank of England had £10 billion in reserve to defend the pound against speculators. George apparently was reading an account of this interview in the next morning’s paper and thought to himself, “£10 billion. What a remarkable coincidence!—that’s exactly the size of the position I was thinking of taking.”

At the time, I remember explaining to the head of the trading floor why the pound would not leave the ERM. I argued that it would be political suicide for the conservative government to drop out of the ERM; hence they would make sure it didn’t happen.

What was your boss’s response?

He just smiled and nodded at me. He said, “Okay, we’ll see.” About three hours later, the pound crashed out of the European ERM. I felt like a complete idiot.

I had absolutely no comprehension of the power of markets versus politics. The policy makers didn’t understand that either. I think, as is often the case, policy makers don’t understand that they are not in control. It’s not that speculators are in control, either, but rather that fundamentals actually matter. Fundamentally, the U.K. remaining in the ERM was untenable. The U.K. was in a recession with a greatly overvalued currency. Germany needed high interest rates to constrain the high inflation of the postunification period with East Germany. Because the currencies were linked, the U.K. was also forced to maintain a high interest rate, even though its ongoing recession dictated a need for the exact opposite policy. All that Soros did was to recognize that the situation was untenable. The Bank of England’s effort to support the pound was the equivalent of trying to fight gravity.

You were lucky to make your first big mistake when you didn’t have any money on the line. Did that episode make an impression on you?

It made a huge impression. I learned that markets matter more than policy. You have to look at real fundamentals, not at what policy makers want to happen. The willing disbelief of people can carry on for a long time, but eventually it is overwhelmed by the market. The genius of Soros was recognizing the turning point when things change—the ability to not only know that a position was right, but that it was right now, and that now was the time to have a big risk on the trade.

[A long discussion ensues about the current (2011) European debt crisis. O’Shea provides a fairly pessimistic assessment of the long-term prospects for the euro.]

You are a macro trader. You see the problem. How do you play it?

I don’t. That is why it’s a bit of a distraction.

You don’t because the timing is so uncertain?

Because no one cares. As long as no one cares about it, there is no trend. Would you be short Nasdaq in 1999? You can’t be short just because you think fundamentally something is overpriced.

What can you do?

You can wait until people start to care. Taking Nasdaq as an example, you want to be selling Nasdaq at 4,000, but only after it has gone to 5,000. So you are selling the market on the way down, not on the way up. Because in a bubble, who is to say how far a market can go. Even though something might be a good idea, you need to wait for and recognize the right time. I am not particularly original. If you read the Financial Times, it’s all there. You don’t have to be a brilliant economist; you just have to recognize when something matters. The financial crisis is another example of the need to wait for the right time. During 2006 to 2007, I was thinking the markets were in a completely unsustainable bubble. It was ridiculous. You saw insanity everywhere.

What was your perception of the insanity at the time?

Risk premium was too low in everything. Credit was trading at ludicrous spreads, and no one cared about quality. What is the one thing you know about a company that posts smooth earnings every single quarter?

They are manipulating the numbers.

Yes. You know nothing beyond that. They may or may not have a good business, but you know they are manipulating numbers. People love stable earnings. Isn’t that great? I hate stable earnings. It just tells me the company is not being truthful. And what I knew about the whole system in 2006 and 2007 was that the true facts were being obscured. The problem was most obvious in the credit markets. But you can’t be short because you lose carry [the interest rate payments on the credit instrument], and at the same time, the spreads get lower and lower. [A decline in the credit spread—that is, the difference between the credit instrument interest rate and the equivalent maturity T-note rate—implies an increase in the credit instrument price.] So you not only have to pay to hold the position, but the position is also going against you. Being short credit in 2006 and 2007 was exactly the same as being short Nasdaq in 1999. You just have to make money going the other way.

How then did you position yourself during 2006 and 2007?

We recognized that we would underperform the bulls by quite a bit because in a bubble the true believers will always win. That’s fine. You just need to make decent returns and wait until the market turns. Then you can make great returns. What I believe in is compounding and not losing money. We were quite happy to be part of the bubble, but to do it in positions that were highly liquid, so that we could exit the market quickly if we wanted to. One of the biggest mistakes people made was to join in the bubble, but to do it in positions for which there was no exit. All markets look liquid during the bubble, but it’s the liquidity after the bubble ends that matters. We did a lot of our trades through options—positions like buying calls in currencies with a carry because the positive carry paid for your option.

Carry currencies are currencies with higher interest rates. For example, if Australian short-term rates are 5 percent and U.S. rates are 1 percent, the Australian dollar would be a carry currency. U.S. investors could convert U.S. dollars into Australian dollars and earn an extra 4 percent interest income. The risk, of course, is that the Australian dollar could decline versus the U.S. dollar in the interim. Although this risk could be hedged by selling Australian dollars in the forward market, arbitrage will assure that the forward rates in the Australian dollar are discounted by the same amount as the interest rate differential. (Otherwise, there would be a risk-free trade in buying spot Australian dollars, investing the proceeds in Australian T-bills, and hedging with a short Australian dollar position in the forward market.) If the spot exchange rate is unchanged, over time, the forward rate will climb by the amount of this differential (i.e., the carry). The strike price on an at-the-money call on a forward contract in the Australian dollar will be lower than the current spot price by the same differential.3 If the spot price remains unchanged, the call will move in the money by this differential by expiration, serving as an offset to the premium paid for the option. Moreover, in a risk-seeking market, carry currencies will also tend to gain in the spot market as well.

Since the underlying currencies are also very liquid, I assume the reason you preferred buying calls to being long carry currencies was to avoid the gap risk in the event of a sudden market reversal?

Yes, by being long options, you can never have a major drawdown. If the bubble continues, you make nice returns; if it collapses, you just lose the premium. You are never short that horrible tail. But there were also structural reasons for preferring long option positions at the time. One of the aspects of risk premiums being very low was that option prices were generally too cheap. I like buying options when they are cheap. It was a low-volatility bubble, which meant that options worked. That’s not always the case.

What other types of trades were you doing during the financial bubble?

What were central banks doing at the time? They were hiking rates. So I did a lot of trades related to monetary policy. During the entire Fed hiking cycle of 2005 to 2006, the futures market kept on being priced on the premise that it was about to stop. The market kept paying you over and over again to take the trade that said maybe it won’t stop. It’s extremely unlikely that the Fed would go from hiking to cutting immediately. Also, monetary policy was still pretty accommodative considering you had all the signs of a bubble. It was quite obvious that you needed higher rates when everything about the economy was signaling that you were in a bubble. So you had a great risk/reward trade that in six months they would still be hiking. As the months rolled on, they kept on hiking, and the market kept on saying, “I’m sure they’ll stop soon.” You could keep on repeating the trade.

Why was the market at the time expecting monetary policy to ease?

I try to avoid conceptualizing the market in anthropomorphic terms. Markets don’t think. Just like mobs don’t think. Why did the mob decide to attack that building? Well, the mob didn’t actually think that. The market simply provides a price that comes about through a collection of human beings.

Okay then, rephrase the question in your own words.

What you are asking is, “Why wasn’t the market priced efficiently?” There are very few market forces to make macro markets priced efficiently. Hedge funds are tiny in the macro space. If you are talking about tech stocks, then sure, hedge funds are massive. But if you are talking about the foreign exchange (FX) market or Treasuries, hedge funds are tiny compared to real money. In comparison, PIMCO or the Chinese are enormous. There are trillions of dollars moving in these markets, which make the little people like me quite irrelevant. We are not a force in pricing. One reason I like macro so much is because I am a small fish swimming in a sea of real money. Fundamentals matter. I am not playing a game against people like me. That would be a zero-sum, difficult game.

Does there have to be an identifiable reason for every trade?

Not necessarily. For example, before the 1998 financial crisis began, I didn’t even know who LTCM was.

Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was the most famous hedge fund failure in history. (Madoff may have been even more prominent, but his operation was a Ponzi scheme rather than a hedge fund. Madoff simply made up performance results and never did any trading.) In its first four years of operation, LTCM generated steady profits, quadrupling the starting net asset value. Then in a five-month period (May to September 1998), it all unraveled, with the net asset value of the fund plunging a staggering 92 percent. LTCM’s positions had been enormously leveraged, placing the banks and brokerage firms that had provided credit to them at enormous risk. Fears that LTCM’s failure could have a domino effect throughout the financial system prompted the Federal Reserve to orchestrate (but not pay for) a bailout for the firm. LTCM’s liquidation of its enormously leveraged positions caused havoc in many financial markets. What made LTCM such a compelling story was not merely the magnitude of the failure and its threat to the financial system, but also the firm’s impressive roster of brainpower, which included two Nobel Prize winners.

At the time, I was doing my own prop trading with no contacts. At the start of the crisis, there was nothing about LTCM in the press, either. I had no idea of any reason for what was going on in the markets, and I had no way of finding out. All I knew was that T-bond futures were going up limit every day. That told me there was something going on. I didn’t need to know why. Once you realize something is happening, you can trade accordingly. Trades don’t have to start based on fundamentals. If you wait until you can find out the reason for the price move, it can be too late. A great Soros quote is “Invest first; investigate later.” You don’t want to get fixated on always needing a nice story for the trade. I am an empiricist at heart. The unfolding reality trumps everything.

I believe in hypothesis testing. The hypothesis is that something big is happening. I don’t know what it is, but it is so powerful that it will carry on for a long time. I should participate in this. But I will do it in a way that is liquid so that if it turns around again, I can get out quickly. If I am wrong, I will have a limited loss. If I am right, who knows what could happen.

Going back to the housing and financial bubble of 2005 to 2007, you originally participated in the bubble. How did you handle the transition to the subsequent market collapse?

I’ll ask you a question: “When did the financial crisis start?”

That’s a difficult question to answer. There are multiple possible starting points. You could say it was the beginning of the housing price decline in 2006, although there was no market response to that at the time. In fact, even Countrywide, who was the poster child for toxic mortgage issuers, went on to set new stock price highs well after that point. Alternatively, you could say it was the collapse of Bear Stearns, although the market rebounded after that event as well.

So, I’ll ask you again: “When did it start?”

Well, that’s a squishy question.

Well, since you’re refusing to give me any kind of answer [he laughs], I’ll give you my answer. Fundamentally, housing prices started to go down in 2006, which didn’t start the crisis, but provided a reason for one. The subprime credit indexes started going down in January 2007. Subprime credit is a niche market, and the equity market was ignoring it. Then in July 2007, there was a broad selloff in the credit markets, but it still was considered a contained credit market issue. Equity people tend to trace the start of the financial crisis to the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008. For me, the true start of the financial crisis was in August 2007 when money markets stopped working. Basically, banks didn’t trust other banks. That was the month the world broke, and no one noticed.

How did you see the money markets breaking down?

The most obvious way was that LIBOR rates spiked. [LIBOR is the rate at which banks lend to other banks.] It was an indicator that the underlying assumption that money would flow smoothly was no longer true. If you spoke to money market desks to find out what was going on, they told you that liquidity had dried up. They had never seen anything like it. If a similar event happened in any other market, it would be front-page news. But the fact that it happened in the most important market—the money market, which is at the heart of capitalism—was largely ignored.

Wasn’t the stress in money markets reported in the financial press?

It was reported. It was all public information, but the point is that no one thought it mattered. Even more than three years later, we are sitting here, and you are saying, “Really, money markets broke down in August 2007? Really?”

Well, I have to admit, when I think of money markets breaking down in the financial crises, I think of the breaking of the buck by some money market funds in the aftermath of the failure of Lehman Brothers and the subsequent freezing up of the commercial paper market. But these events occurred more than a year later in September 2008.

That’s my point. No one seemed to think it was important. The S&P actually went on to make new highs in the next two months.

But you made your transition from bullish positions to bearish in August 2007?

Yes, I turned bearish when money market liquidity dried up in August 2007. Declining housing prices were the impending storm clouds, but it started raining when money markets stopped working. Most people, however, didn’t notice. Fundamentals are not about forecasting the weather for tomorrow, but rather noticing that it is raining today.

The great trades don’t require predictions. The Soros trade of going short the pound in 1992 was based on something that had already happened—an ongoing deep recession that made it inevitable that the U.K. would not maintain the high interest rates required by remaining in the ERM. Afterward, everyone said, “That was incredibly obvious.” Most of the great trades are incredibly obvious. It was the same in late 2007. In my mind, it was clear that the financial system was imploding and that most market participants hadn’t noticed.

Did you go short equities then?

Equity markets would eventually notice, but being short equities is a hard trade because they might still keep going up for a long time. After a bull market that goes on for years, who is managing most of the money? The bears are all unemployed; they’re not managing any money at all. You have a few very flexible smart people, but they run relatively small amounts of money; so they don’t matter, either. The managers who are relentlessly bullish and who buy more every time the market goes down will be the ones who end up managing most of the money. So, you shouldn’t expect a big bull market to end in any rational fashion.

The smart managers will be managing less because they don’t look as good as the bulls, since they’re going to have lower net long exposure?

Right. Because the bulls control most of the money, you should expect the transition to a bear market to be quite slow, but then for the move to be enormous when the turn does happen. Then the bulls will say, “This makes no sense. This was unforeseeable.” Well, it clearly wasn’t unforeseeable.

I have to laugh when I hear people say it was unforeseeable that housing prices could go down. I think, “Did you ever look at a housing price chart?” If you look at a long-term inflation-adjusted chart of housing prices, you can see that excluding the postdepression bust, since the 19th century, housing prices consistently moved in a sideways range, until the mid-2000s when inflation-adjusted prices nearly doubled in a few years. It sticks out like a mountain in a plateau. Yet people can claim with a straight face that they were shocked that housing prices could go down after that abnormal surge.

If you live in a world where everyone assumes that everything goes up forever, then it is inconceivable that prices might go down. Big price changes occur when market participants are forced to reevaluate their prejudices, not necessarily because the world changes that much. The world really didn’t change that much in 2008. It was just that people finally noticed there was a problem.

Consider the current U.S. debt problem. A lot of people say there is apparently no inflationary threat from the growing U.S. debt because bond yields are low. But that’s not true. Bond yields will only signal that there is a problem when it is too late to fix it. You have to believe in market efficiency to believe that the market will adequately price fiscal risk. Could there be a crisis in five years? Sure. Why? Because people start to care. Currently, it’s not in the price. But one day, it might be. If a major financial catastrophe happens, people will talk about how it was caused by this event or that event. If it happens, though, it will be because there were fundamental reasons that were there all along.

There will always be something that happens at the same time. Calling it a catalyst isn’t very helpful in explaining anything. Did World War I start because the Archduke was assassinated? Well, kind of, but mainly not. I don’t subscribe to the catalyst theory of history. But most people love it, especially in markets, because they can point to that one cause and say, “Who knew that could happen?”

When you have tremendous fundamental imbalances, the change can occur anywhere along the way. Nasdaq topped above 5,000, but it could just as well have been 3,000 or 7,000. It just happened to top above 5,000. Predicting the top of a bubble is like trying to predict the weather one year out—the same set of conditions can lead to wildly different outcomes if replayed multiple times.

Absolutely right, and I can’t predict that turnaround. It’s very difficult. But you can notice when things have changed. Most people, though, don’t. When Nasdaq is at 4,000 after having been at 5,000, there are lots of people buying it because it is cheap. They reason, “It used to be 5,000. Now it’s only 4,000. I am getting a bargain.” People are very poorly attuned to making decisions when there is uncertainty. Do you know the difference between risk and uncertainty?

Do you mean that in the realm of risk, you know the odds, but with uncertainty, you don’t know the odds?

Right. If you play roulette, you are in the world of risk. If you are dealing with possible economic events, you are in the world of uncertainty. If you don’t know the odds, putting a number on something makes no sense. What are the odds of Germany leaving the euro in the next five years? There is no way of assigning a probability. If you try to force it by saying something like “6.2 percent,” it is a meaningless number because you would have to behave as if you believed it, and that would be a poor bet.

Going back to August 2007, recognizing that there was a change, how did you respond? You already explained why you didn’t go short equity, but what did you do instead? Did you cover all your bullish positions right away?

Yes, getting out of everything was an easy decision. Then you look for trades that have great reward to risk. Since volatility was cheap, one trade we did was buying FX volatility.

When you say you bought volatility, does that imply that you were not playing for any directional move in currencies?

Yes, our assumption was only that it would move somewhere.

So you put on positions like long straddles and strangles in currencies?

Yes. Another big position was related to monetary policy. What did Greenspan do after the 1987 crash?

He injected liquidity.

Right. Add liquidity and cut rates. That was the policy response we expected. So that was our trade at the time: Rates would go lower and the yield curve would steepen.

So you put on long positions in short-term rate instruments?

Yes, but we coupled it with short positions on the long end because it was a better risk/reward trade. The yield curve was flat at the time and priced to stay flat. The market wasn’t pricing in any risk that there would be a major problem.

So you bet on lower short-term rates through a yield curve spread rather than a long position in short-term rate instruments because you felt it was a safer way to do the trade.

Yes, because what I am trying to do is find trades that won’t lose much money even if I am wrong.

Your reasoning was that if you were wrong, long rates would go up about as much as short rates, so you wouldn’t lose much money, but if you were right most of the rate decline would occur in short rates.

Yes, exactly.

So, you are not only looking for the right trade, but also for the best way to express it.

Yes, I think implementation is the key in everything. Implementation is more important than the trade idea behind it. Having a beautiful idea doesn’t get you very far if you don’t do it the right way. The point is that I tried to do the trade in a way so that my timing didn’t have to be perfect.

Were there other trades you did at the time?

There were a lot. We were bearish on corporate credit, so we bought CDS protection. Since credit spreads were very narrow, if we were wrong, we would only lose a little bit of carry, but if we were right, the spreads could widen a lot. It was an asymmetric trade.

Corporate bonds pay a higher interest rate than U.S. Treasury notes to compensate investors for the higher risk. The yield difference is called the credit spread. The lower the individual bond rating, the wider the spread. Overall credit spread levels will widen during times of financial crisis when investors will demand higher interest rate differentials for accepting the greater risk implicit in holding corporate bonds instead of Treasuries. There are several ways to initiate a trade that will profit if credit spreads widen. The most direct trade is shorting the corporate bond. The equivalent trade can also be implemented through derivatives by buying credit default swap (CDS) protection on the bond. A CDS is essentially an insurance policy that pays off if the bond defaults. The buyer of CDS protection, however, does not need to own the underlying bond—that is, the transaction can be made strictly as a speculative trade (one that profits from a deterioration in credit quality). The CDS price is quoted as an annual spread—the per annum amount the buyer of protection pays the seller (in quarterly payments). (The CDS spread is the “carry” on the trade.) If a bond’s creditworthiness deteriorates (an event associated with the credit spread widening), the CDS spread will widen as well. A third way of placing a trade that will profit from widening credit spreads, and the one employed by O’Shea, is to buy a CDS on an index based on a basket of corporate bonds. Note that buying CDS protection has an option-like payoff: The maximum risk is limited (to the per annum spread paid, which is analogous to an option premium), while the gain can be much larger (up to a theoretical maximum of the amount protected).

Why did you consider buying CDS protection a better trade than buying equity puts?

Actually, they are very similar trades. If the equity market stayed strong, the loss in both positions would be limited—to the option premium for the puts and to the carry for the CDS position. If the equity markets fell, credit spreads would widen, and both long puts and long CDS protection positions would have large profits. The advantage of CDS was that it was a cheaper way of doing the trade. One problem with buying equity puts is that equity volatility tends to be very expensive. Who is the natural seller of equity puts? No one. Who is the natural buyer of equity puts? Everyone. The world is long equities, and people like owning insurance, so there is an excess of natural buyers for equity puts. That is why equity option prices are structurally expensive.

After you turned bearish in August 2007, did you maintain that view all the way through the collapse of markets in late 2008?

Maintaining the same long-term view doesn’t mean I kept the same positions. My typical time horizon for trades is one to three months. When prices change, the risk/reward on positions change.

I understand that your specific positions changed, but did you maintain an unwavering commitment to the bearish side, even during the significant rebound in the second quarter of 2008?

The reason the market bounced in the second quarter of 2008 was that people felt that the Bear Stearns bailout in March 2008 had solved the problem.

What did you think?

I thought that was clearly wrong. The big mistake people were making, and still make, was to confuse liquidity with solvency. People were acting on the premise that Bear Stearns and the banking system were solvent. They thought there was a liquidity crisis, which was just a matter of lack of confidence. The reality was that the banking system didn’t have a liquidity problem; it had a liquidity problem because it had a solvency problem. You can’t fix a solvency problem by adding more liquidity. If you have a house worth $100,000 with a $200,000 mortgage, I can lend you another $100,000, but it won’t solve the underlying problem. You’ll just end up with more debt. As long as housing prices kept going down, the solvency problem was getting worse and worse. The market, however, was behaving as if there was no problem.

Where does that leave you in terms of a trading stance when the market is acting as if everything is okay, but you think it’s not?

Well, that happens all the time. In regards to the second quarter of 2008, we found better risk/reward trades to express our view. We had been very negative on credit at the start of the year. But by the second quarter, corporate and bank credit spreads had already widened sharply. Although the TED spread had also widened sharply, in the forward market, it was priced to narrow dramatically over the next few months.

The TED spread is the difference between the three-month LIBOR rate, the rate at which banks lend to other banks, and the three-month T-bill rate. The LIBOR rate is always higher than the T-bill rate because there is a small counterparty risk in interbank loans, while T-bills are considered to be risk-free. During most times, the TED spread tends to be relatively modest (roughly around 25 basis points). The TED spread, however, can widen significantly during periods of “flight-to-quality” when counterparty and liquidity concerns are heightened. It widened to more than 200 basis points in the money market liquidity freeze-up in August 2007 that O’Shea talked about earlier and to a record 485 basis points in the post-Lehman failure financial market meltdown in late 2008. The types of conditions that are conducive to a widening of the TED spread often occur during steep equity market declines. In this sense, a long TED spread is a bearish position.

In contrast, corporate and bank credit spreads were priced to stay wide in the forward market. So we rotated out of our short credit trades into TED spreads because the risk/reward was much better. During the second quarter of 2008, both corporate credit spreads and TED spreads narrowed. The TED spread, however, had been priced to narrow in the forward market, so the trade was near breakeven. If we had stayed with the short corporate credit positions during the second quarter of 2008, we would have lost a lot of money. The trade we had switched into to express our negative long-term view didn’t have much downside. So when everybody got optimistic again in the second quarter of 2008, our bearish position [the TED spread] didn’t change that much.

What about the second half of 2008, which was when markets collapsed?

If you started with the premise that there was a solvency issue, then everything that happened was straightforward. To begin, the banking system was underwater. Therefore, there was no reason for anyone to lend them money, unless the government was going to step in with more capital. The politics in Washington at the time, however, was for no more bailouts. [Treasury Secretary] Paulson had made multiple statements in which he was very clear that there would be no government bailout of Lehman. Once you know that Lehman has negative value and the government is not coming to the rescue, that means they’re bankrupt. There isn’t anything else that can happen. There is no sophisticated analysis involved. The odd thing is that Lehman going under was not a surprise. Most people knew it was going to happen, but they failed to understand what it meant.

So what were you doing at the time?

The main thing was to make sure our business was as safe as possible. We avoided counterparty exposure to Lehman. We simplified the book. We reduced leverage a lot during 2008. We restricted our trading to highly liquid positions, which meant avoiding OTC trades with lots of counterparties. Insofar as we had to have counterparty risk, we confined it to the strongest counterparties.

Okay, those are measures to reduce business risk, but what trades did you put on to take advantage of the situation you saw?

We had very similar trades to the ones we had on at the start of 2008. We were long volatility, short credit, long the TED spread, and long the dollar because of an expected flight to quality. All of these trades had one thing in common: They were all the-world-is-going-to-get-scary trades.

These were all trades that you put back on in the third quarter of 2008 prior to the Lehman failure?

Yes.

As the markets collapsed in the ensuing months, at what point did you decide it was a good time to take money off the table?

April 2009.

So you stayed with all these bearish positions all the way through the entire decline?

Yes, until we started to lose money.

What changed in April 2009 that prompted you to get out of your positions?

Two things changed: The economy stopped getting worse, and markets started going up. The underlying problems had not gone away, but that isn’t the market driver. The fact that the economy was improving, even though it was still in bad shape, meant that the optimists could come back. Never underestimate the ability of people to be optimistic and believe that everything is going to be okay. Historically, what is important to the market is not whether growth is good or bad, but whether it is getting better or worse. Growth started getting less negative, and less negative is good news. Asia started going up. The Australian dollar started going up. The S&P was actually one of the last markets to turn higher in March 2009. By March to April, you were seeing a broad-based recovery in global markets.

What trades did you transition to?

Bullish strategies. Interest rates were pricing in another Great Depression. Once the market prices in a Great Depression, you think, “Well, maybe not.” Ten-year yields were down near 2 percent. Things have to look really bad to justify that level. Once the outlook started to improve a little bit, yields could rise a lot from that level. So we went short long-term Treasuries, both outright and as a yield curve play. We went short the dollar, as a reversal of the prior flight-to-quality trade. We did a lot of different trades. Typically, in the portfolio, we will have 10 or 15 different trades on at any time. One reason why I am always hesitant to explain what trades we did is that if I get to the level of complexity of including all the trades, it can get very confusing. If I simplify it by saying that it’s a bit like these two or three trades, then people say, “Oh, you did that; that’s quite easy.” Well, it isn’t what we actually did, but you try to provide a simplification to make it understandable. Then people think that simplification is what you actually did. I think macro is most misunderstood when it is seen as storytelling. Storytelling is a nice way to talk about it, but it is only 10 percent of what is important.

And the other 90 percent?

Implementation and flexibility. You need to implement a trade in a way that limits your losses when you are wrong, and you also need to be able to recognize when a trade is wrong. George Soros has the least regret of anyone I have ever met. Even though he will sometimes play up to his public image as a guru who knows what is going on, it is in no sense what he does as a money manager. He has no emotional attachment to an idea. When a trade is wrong, he will just cut it, move on, and do something else. I remember one time he had this huge FX position. He made something like $250 million on it in one day. He was quoted in the financial press talking about the position. It sounded like a major strategic view he had. Then the market went the other way, and the position just disappeared. It was gone. He didn’t like the price action, so he got out. He doesn’t let his structural views on how he believes the market will play out get in the way of his trading. That is what strikes me about really good money managers—they don’t get attached to their ideas. The danger in the narrative I have been giving you is that it may lead to the false impression that what you need to do to make lots of money is be really smart in economics and understand fundamentally what is going on. I don’t really believe that is true.

What do you believe is true?

I actually subscribe to a lot of things in your books. You need a method that suits your personality. I don’t believe that I am an amazing economist who predicts the future. What I actually believe is that I recognize the world as I find it and that I am flexible enough to change my mind. In April 2009, I was really pessimistic. I thought the world was in terrible condition. But the market was telling me that I was wrong. So I thought, “Okay, I’m completely wrong. What is a different hypothesis of what is going on? Ah, here is a different hypothesis. I see what’s going on. Let’s do that instead.” Then there is an explanatory story that comes out afterwards. But actually, the story came after my previous hypothesis had been proven wrong. It wasn’t that I was smart and caught the turning point. I didn’t. I just noticed that what I was doing was wrong and that I needed to do something else. To construct a portfolio, I need to build a set of hypotheses that I can test in the market.

So the empiricism comes first, then the macro theme to fit the observations, and finally the implementation of the trades.

Yes, but the point is that the macro theme has to be testable empirically in the market. It is not about starting out with any grand theme. The difference between what I’m doing and trend following is that there have to be logical fundamental linkages for the price movements. China is turning around, metal prices are turning higher, and the Australian dollar is moving up. What is that telling me? There is recovery somewhere in the world. There is demand somewhere in the world. The S&P may still be going down, but there is divergence in the data. If the whole world is terrible, it doesn’t fit anymore. So I can’t stick with the-whole-world-is-terrible thesis. Something else is going on. What hypothesis would fit the actual developments? Asia actually looks all right now. A scenario that would fit is an Asia-led economic recovery. If the new hypothesis is correct, then certain other things should happen in the future. In contrast to the trend follower, I am anticipating future trends, rather than waiting for the trends to develop and then jumping on. I may end up being in many of the same trades as a trend follower, but the timing is going to be very different.

Do you trade equity indexes or equities?

Equity indexes and baskets, yes, but not that much.

Why aren’t you a fan of trading equities?

Interest rate markets or FX are usually better ways for me to express trades. The world is full of people who trade equities. I don’t think another hedge fund that trades equities is particularly exciting. Also, a problem I have with equities is that equity stories make no sense to me. Equity people often make no sense to me. The reasons I think trades have worked are usually nothing like the reasons why equity people think they worked. In my entire life, I’ve personally only done one single-stock trade.

Out of curiosity, because it was the only one, what was it?

I bought Berkshire in 1999.

And that was because?

The price had halved because Buffett refused to be involved in the dot-com bubble. I thought that was the stupidest reason I had ever heard for a stock price to halve. Nasdaq is going through the roof. Warren Buffett, who is clearly one of the all-time legends of investing, is saying I don’t understand this dot-com stuff; I’m staying away from it. And his stock price gets hammered because he’s seen as a dinosaur that isn’t part of the new paradigm. I thought that was idiotic.

Buffett being penalized for underperforming versus managers riding the long side of the dot-com bubble is a perfect illustration of a common investor mistake—failing to realize that often the managers with the highest returns achieve those results because they’re taking the most risk, not because they have the greatest skill. How long did you hold the position?

Until I started my hedge fund. I believed in myself more than I believed in Warren Buffett.

Let’s go back to when you first started out at Citigroup the week the U.K. was forced out of the ERM. When did you begin trading?

My first trade ever was the year after. They gave new traders small limits they were allowed to trade. I remember doing a really good fundamental analysis about the U.K. economy and deciding that the rate hikes the market was pricing in were not going to happen. I proved to be perfectly correct. Three months later, they still hadn’t hiked rates, and short sterling [U.K. short-term interest rates] rallied 100 basis points from where I had the trade idea. Well, I lost money.

How did you lose money when your forecast was exactly correct?

It’s pretty straightforward. The implementation didn’t match the hypothesis. The hypothesis was clearly a one-to-three-month horizon. So, I should have traded a one-to-three-month horizon. What did I do? I was constantly getting in and out because I was scared of losing money. The rational trade hypothesis was beautiful. The implementation was entirely emotional and stupid. I realized that you have to embrace uncertainty and risk. Over a three-month period, it is the trend that is important.

I guess the lesson is that the market is not going to let you make any money unless you’re willing to take risk.

You have to embrace the logical consequences of your ideas, and that means that you have to have a stop loss that is wide enough.

So even though you were on the right side of the trend for three months, you lost money because you kept on getting stopped out.

Yes, because I had read trading books. It took me a while to realize that those trading books are counterproductive because the rules are generic and not specific. Most trading book rules are designed for people who have the error of excess optimism and are in emotional denial of their losses. Trading book rules are designed to protect traders who are gamblers. People who like trading because they like gambling are always going to be terrible at it. For these people, the trading books could be greatly shortened to the message: “Don’t trade. You are really bad at this. So just don’t do it.” I don’t actually have a gambler’s mentality. I make different emotional mistakes. So, imposing trading book rules on me is a terrible misfit.

That is why your books are important. All the traders you write about have a method that is personal and fits them. You learn from everyone around you, but you have to do what makes sense for you, even if it’s the opposite of what makes sense for other people.

So you don’t use stops?

No. I do. I just set them wide enough. In those early days, I wasn’t setting stops at levels that made sense based on the underlying hypothesis for the trade; I was setting stops based on my pain threshold, and the market doesn’t care about your pain. I learned from that mistake. When I get out of a trade now, it is because I was wrong. I’m thinking, “Hmm, that shouldn’t have happened. Prices are inconsistent with my hypothesis. I’m wrong. I need to get out and rethink the situation.” In my first trade, prices were never inconsistent with my hypothesis.

What are some other mistakes you have learned from?

I don’t have any great example of a mistake that cost me a material amount of money because I have very tight risk discipline on the downside. Stopping yourself from losing money is quite easy. I’ve never really had that problem. I’d say that most of my big errors have been opportunity errors. I sometimes believe in something so strongly that it acts as a constraint on doing trades that could be very profitable. For example, in late 2010, my underlying belief that the European sovereign debt crisis was a really big problem made it hard for me to participate in a sentiment and liquidity driven bull market. I failed to take part in the biggest macro theme of the year. From September on, equities were up a lot, and commodities were up a lot. It was a massive opportunity that I should have been in, and I wasn’t. I missed the key point that no one else cared, and as long as no one cares, there is no crisis. It’s the same reason I didn’t make any money in the Nasdaq bubble. I thought, “I can’t buy Pets.com.”

But actually you can’t make money in the Nasdaq bubble by definition.

You can.

How do you go long a bubble and protect yourself?

When it starts to go down, you sell it.

It turned out that the Nasdaq move up was relatively smooth, but a bubble could be very volatile.

That’s when you don’t get involved. Actually what I’ve learned is that bubbles last a long time, and that there’s money to be made out of bubbles.

Without the benefit of hindsight, how could you play a Nasdaq-type move now?

The main thing about bubbles is that you need to be early. The worst thing you can do in a bubble is to be stubborn and then late to convert. I have avoided late conversions. But what I am trying to learn is to be an earlier convert to things that make no sense. I have an aversion to things that make no sense, and I should get over that.

I guess that sometimes the reason for a bull market is psychological rather than fundamental, and participating in the euphoria of a psychological move is itself the rationale for the trade.

Yes, and I don’t mind that. What I have difficulty with is when the fundamentals are in conflict with the euphoria. I have tended to be premature in worrying about the conflicting fundamentals. I think in terms of the next 10 or 20 years I’d like to do a better job of monetizing other people’s irrational euphoria.

So, one of your shortcomings has been in letting your rational assessment of a situation keep you from participating in a psychologically driven trade.

Yes, failing to participate in markets when the fundamentals are less important than the psychology.

But how do you recognize that type of situation?

Well, that’s the key question, isn’t it? [He laughs.] There are various gauges. A simple one is just price action. If it trades like a bull market, it’s a bull market. Another indication is how passionately people defend things that make no sense. For example, some people believe that Barack Obama is not a U.S. citizen. The point is that beliefs that are completely invulnerable to evidence and passionately defended can be quite durable. It has nothing to do with the fundamental logic.

That’s a political example. But what would be a tradable example?

Gold is special, magical, and great. It’s not. But if people believe it, they buy it. And if they buy it, it goes up. That’s why there’s a bull market. You can’t go to a meeting without someone saying, “What do you think about gold?”

What does that tell you?

It tells you that you should be long gold.

So, going back to the Nasdaq bubble, another example would be people saying that it doesn’t matter if a company is losing money, all that matters is how many clicks they are getting on their website.

Yes, exactly. The utter irrationality of the fundamental justification doesn’t matter. And if you try and point that out to somebody, they will just give you an even more ridiculous justification why the market should go up. You cannot shake them at all from their belief. Those are the characteristics of bubble markets. The reason why they have legs is because it takes such enormous evidence to make people change their minds.

How do you know when it does change?

You know the dot-com bubble is over when it starts going down. It will be the same thing with gold.

Right now as we talk, gold is somewhere just north of $1,500 and not far from its all-time high. So what you are saying is that the gold top could be now; it could be at $2,000; it could be at $2,500; it could be any number.

And that’s okay. The thing about gold is that if you told me gold has a price of $100, that’s fine. If you told me it’s $10,000, that’s fine as well. It can be any price. Gold is worth exactly what people think it’s worth.

I am sure you know why that is true for gold.

What do you think?

This is one of those questions that can be answered unambiguously. Gold is the only commodity where the amount of supply is literally about 100 times as much as the amount physically used in any year. That is not true of any other commodity, such as wheat or copper, where total supply and annual consumption are much closer in balance, and true shortages can develop. There is never any shortage of gold. So gold’s value is entirely dependent on psychology or those fundamentals that drive psychology. Many years ago, when I was a commodity research director, I would totally ignore gold production and consumption in analyzing the market. I would base any price expectation entirely on such factors as inflation and the value of the dollar because those are the factors that drive psychology. I always found it ridiculous when other analysts would write lengthy reports on gold analyzing such things as annual production prospects and jewelry usage. Annual production and consumption of gold are always a tiny fraction of supply, maybe around 1 percent, so who cares how much they change. It has nothing to with the price.

Yes, that’s exactly right.

It’s one thing to say that a market in a bubble can go to any price, but quite another to determine when the bubble is over. You said just before that you know it’s over when the price starts going down. But how do you differentiate between a correction and a reversal in the market?

That is a good question and quite a difficult one. There are several possible methods. The simplest method is to pretend you are a CTA.4 A CTA will have a systematic way of defining when a trend has changed. Another way you can tell is if the market displays price action that is characteristic of the late stages of a bubble, such as an exponential price rise, similar to what we recently saw in silver [in May 2011].

Did you trade that market?

Yes, through options. The problem with markets like silver is that when they break, they can collapse rapidly, and there is gap risk. I think the natural way to trade a market that is in a bubble is from the long side, not the short side. You want to be long the exponential upmove without taking on the gap risk of a collapse. Therefore options provide a good way of doing this type of trade.

Since the silver price move exhibited characteristics of a bubble, why wouldn’t you also consider trading the market from the short side?

Because tops are messy, and the reversals in bear markets are horrendous. It is very rare to find comfortable shorts in bear markets. If you consider Nasdaq as an example, it was quite an easy trade from the long side for a long time. It went from 1,500 in late 1998 to over 5,000 in early 2000 with hardly any meaningful corrections. From the short side, it was a really tough trade. After breaking down in very whippy fashion to under 3,100 in June 2000, the market then rallied back to near 4,300 in the next two months. This was a 40 percent rebound in a market that was clearly dead. Postbubble dead cat bounces can be vicious.

Sounds more like a dead tiger bounce.

I don’t think you will find many people that have made the majority of their money shorting bubbles.

Does that imply that you didn’t trade the Nasdaq from the short side even after you were sure the bull market was dead?

No, I didn’t because the repercussions of the top were a lot easier to play than being short the Nasdaq itself. You had a broad bubble in assets. The U.S. economy had been built up by a massive mispricing of assets. Once the Nasdaq burst and everything unraveled, it was clear the economy would slow down. The economic downturn led to a big move in fixed income that provided a much calmer way to play that idea than a direct trade in equities.

So rather than consider the short side of the Nasdaq, you traded the long side of the bonds.

That’s right.

Are there any current examples of markets that are in euphoria-driven states that are running counter to fundamentals?

I wouldn’t say they are counter to the fundamentals, but rather that they are overpricing one particular outcome. For example, European sovereign debt may be fairly priced if you have a strong conviction that the outcome will be a federated Europe in which the German taxpayer will pick up the bills. If you anticipate a less optimistic scenario, then current prices may not make much sense. A few weeks ago, Spanish debt was trading at only 150 basis points over Germany.

So the market is pricing in a solution.

Yes, it’s pricing a solution that may not happen; 150 basis points is not zero, but it is a lot closer to zero than the current 1,000-plus basis point premium on Greek debt. The relatively small premium for Spanish debt reflects a high degree of confidence in a particular outcome. I am not suggesting the more negative outcome is more likely, but simply that there is more uncertainty than implied by the current moderate premium.

In a situation like this where there is a binary outcome that is highly uncertain, but the probabilities are different from what the market seems to be pricing, do you participate in the market?

That is the main part of what I do. I look for deviations between the fundamental probability distribution I perceive and the probability distribution priced in by the market.

Being short Spanish debt is a trade where the downside is limited to the annual carry, but the upside can be very substantial. It seems that an inherent characteristic of most of your trades is that they have an asymmetric quality—the maximum loss is limited, but the profit potential is open-ended.

Yes, having a positive skew is very important. It is not about being right all the time. Most good macro traders will be right only about half the time or even less.

Is trading a skill that can be taught?

It can’t be taught, but it can be learned.

What do you mean by that?

My natural trade time horizon is one to three months, but that doesn’t mean it would be right for you. Since I don’t know you, I can’t tell you what your trading style should be. But if you are willing to put in the effort, you can learn what that style should be. If I try to teach you what I do, you will fail because you are not me. If you hang around me, you will observe what I do, and you may pick up some good habits. But there are a lot of things you will want to do differently. A good friend of mine, who sat next to me for several years, is now managing lots of money at another hedge fund and doing very well. But he is not the same as me. What he learned was not to become me. He became something else. He became him.

Are there traits that determine who will be a successful trader?

Perseverance and the emotional resilience to keep coming back are critical because as a trader you get beaten up horribly. Frankly, if you don’t love it, there are much better things to do with your life. You can’t trade because you think it is a way to make a lot of money. That won’t cut it. No one who trades for the money is going to be any good. If successful traders were only motivated by the money, they would just stop after five years and enjoy the material things. They don’t. They continue well beyond any financial need. They can be somewhat obsessive. Trading is simply what they do. Jack Nicklaus has plenty of money. Why did he keep playing competitive golf well into his sixties? Probably because he really liked playing golf. He probably had a compulsive need to do it.

Are there trading rules you adhere to?

I use risk guidelines, but I don’t believe in rules in that way. Traders who are successful over the long run adapt. If they do use rules, and you meet them 10 years later, they will have broken those rules. Why? Because the world changed. Rules are only applicable to a market at a specific time. Traders who fail may have great rules that work, but then stop working. They stick to the rules because the rules used to work, and they are quite annoyed that they are losing even though they are still doing what they used to do. They don’t realize that the world has moved on without them.

Besides failure to adapt, what other mistakes get traders into trouble?

People run large amounts of money with relatively unsophisticated risk management. Throughout 2008, I spoke to managers who said they had halved their risk. I would say, “Half, that’s quite a lot.” Then they would continue and say, “Yes, my leverage was four, and it is now two.” I would answer, “Do you realize volatility has gone up five times?” In terms of volatility-adjusted leverage, their risk exposure had actually gone up.

I notice that you use VAR as a risk measurement. Aren’t you concerned that it can sometimes be very misleading regarding portfolio risk?

Value at Risk (VAR) can be defined as the loss threshold that will not be exceeded within a specified time interval at some high confidence level (typically, 95 percent or 99 percent). The VAR can be stated in either dollar or percentage terms. For example, a 3.2 percent daily VAR at the 99 percent confidence level would imply that the daily loss is expected to exceed 3.2 percent on only 1 out of 100 days. To convert a VAR from daily to monthly, we multiply it by the square root of 22 (the approximate number of trading days in a month). Therefore the 3.2 percent daily VAR would also imply that the monthly loss is expected to exceed 15.0 percent (3.2 percent × 4.69) only once out of every 100 months. The convenient thing about VAR is that it provides a worst-case loss estimate for a portfolio of mixed investments and adapts to the specific holdings as the portfolio composition changes. There are several ways of calculating VAR, but they all depend on the volatility and correlations of the portfolio holdings during a past look-back period—and therein lies the rub. The VAR provides a worst-case loss estimate assuming future volatility and correlation levels look like the past.

The main reason the VAR gets a bad name is because people don’t understand it. VAR does exactly what it says on the tin.

Which is?

It tells you how volatile your current portfolio was in the past. That is all. VAR is entirely backward looking. You have to recognize that the future will be different. If I think the world in the future will be highly volatile, then I will run a current VAR that is relatively low because I think the future will be more volatile than the past.

VAR gets a bad name because people manage risk by it, and the shortcoming is that volatilities and correlations can change very radically on an existing portfolio vis-à-vis what they were in the past.

But that is patently obvious.

If it is so obvious, how come so many people manage risk that way?

VAR doesn’t blow up portfolios; people do.

Do you ever have a problem getting out of a losing trade?

I start by deciding where the market would have to go for me to be wrong. That’s where I place my stop. That means that it’s not difficult for me to get out of a position if the market goes there. The most common money management error I see is people setting stop losses that are really pain thresholds. When the market reaches their stop, they don’t really want to get out because they still think they are right. They will get out because their stop is hit, and they are disciplined. But very soon afterwards, they will want to get back in because they don’t think they were wrong. That’s how day traders in Nasdaq in 2000 and 2001 lost a ton of money. They were disciplined, so they would close out their positions by the end of the day. But they kept on repeating the same trading mistake. They failed to recognize that they were completely wrong because we were in a bear market.

So the disciplined use of stops that are set too close could lead to the proverbial death by 1,000 cuts.

Yes, and that is why I think trading books that provide specific rules can be quite dangerous. They can lead to the illusion that you are in control and being disciplined. And it is true that you are restricting yourself from a single catastrophic loss, but it doesn’t prevent repeated losses on the same idea.

Sometimes a close stop may be appropriate. If it is a short-term technical idea, and you don’t like the trade anymore if the market breaks a level, then getting out on a close stop is fine. If, however, it is a fundamental idea that needs a long time to play out, then a short-term stop makes absolutely no sense. If your entry and exit strategy is out of sync with the reason you like the trade, then you don’t have an internally consistent money management plan, which means it will fail.

So, you need to decide where you are wrong before you determine the stop point.

First, you decide where you are wrong. That determines where the stop level should be. Then you work out how much you are willing to lose on the idea. Last, you divide the amount you’re willing to lose by the per-contract loss to the stop point, and that determines your position size. The most common error I see is that people do it backwards. They start with position size. Then they know their pain threshold, and that determines where they place their stop.



The popular perception of the successful global macro manager is a trader who has an ability to forecast major trends in world markets (FX, interest rates, equities, commodities) through skillful analysis and insight. O’Shea emphasizes that his edge is not forecasting what will happen, but rather recognizing what has happened. O’Shea believes that it is very difficult to pick a major turning point, such as where a market bubble will top, and that trying to do so is a losing strategy. Instead, he waits until events occur that confirm a trading hypothesis. For example, he thought that excessive risk-taking during 2005 to 2007 had inflated various markets beyond reasonable levels and left the financial markets vulnerable to a major selloff. Nevertheless, insofar as he sees his role as trading in response to the prevailing market facts, rather than forecasting turning points, he actually had bullish positions on during this time. He did not switch to a bearish posture until an event occurred that he saw as a confirmation that the markets were in the process of rolling over—the drying up of liquidity in the money markets in August 2007. He didn’t need to forecast anything, but he did need to recognize the significance of an event that many ignored. Indeed, the S&P 500 went on to make new highs in the next two months.

O’Shea believes that how a trade is implemented is more important than the trade idea itself. He seeks to implement a trade in the way that provides the best return-to-risk and limits losses in the event the trade is wrong. For example, after liquidity dried up in the money markets in August 2007, O’Shea expected rates to be cut. Instead of expressing this trade idea only through long short-term interest rate instrument positions, O’Shea also implemented the trade as a yield curve spread: long short-term rate instruments/short long-term rate instruments. His reasoning was that the yield curve at the time was relatively flat, implying that a rate decline would most likely be concentrated on the short-term end of the yield curve. If, however, rates went up, the flat yield curve implied that long-term rates should go up at least as much as short-term rates and probably more. The yield curve spread provided most of the profit potential with only a fraction of the risk. In essence, it provided a much better return-to-risk ratio than a straight long position in short-term rates alone.

The Nasdaq peak provided another example of how O’Shea seeks the best return-to-risk strategy to implement a trade idea. After the break from the March 2000 peak, O’Shea felt fairly certain that the bubble had burst. Yet he did not consider short positions in Nasdaq, even though he believed the market had formed a major bubble top, because he recognized—correctly, as it turned out—that trading the short side was treacherous. Even though the market ultimately went sharply lower, in the summer of 2000, the index witnessed an approximate 40 percent rebound. A move of this magnitude would very likely have resulted in a short position being stopped out. O’Shea reasoned that a Nasdaq top implied that most assets would recede from inflated levels, which would lead to an economic slowdown and lower interest rates. A long bond position provided a much easier and more comfortable way to trade the same idea. Bonds subsequently witnessed a fairly smooth uptrend, in contrast to the highly erratic downtrend in Nasdaq.

Flexibility is an essential quality to successful trading. It is important not to get attached to an idea and to always be willing to get out of a trade if the price action is inconsistent with the trade hypothesis. O’Shea cites George Soros as a master of flexibility who has no attachment to his trades and shows the least regret about getting out of a position of anyone he has ever met. In April 2009, O’Shea was very pessimistic about the financial outlook, but the market behavior was telling him he was wrong. Since his bearish hypothesis was inconsistent with the market price action, he formulated an entirely different hypothesis that seemed to fit what was happening—that is, the markets were seeing the beginning of an Asia-led economic recovery. Staying with his original market expectation would have been disastrous, as both equity and commodity markets embarked on a multiyear rally. The flexibility to recognize that his premise was mistaken and to act on that awareness allowed O’Shea to experience a profitable year, even though his original market outlook was completely wrong.

O’Shea believes that the best way to trade a market bubble is to participate on the long side to profit from the excessive euphoria, not to try to pick a top, which is nearly impossible and an approach vulnerable to large losses if one is early. The bubble cycle is easier to trade from the long side because the uptrend in a bubble is often relatively smooth, while the downtrend after the bubble bursts tends to be highly erratic. There are two components necessary to successfully trade the long side of a bubble. First, it is important to initiate a trade early in the bubble phase. Second, since bubbles are prone to abrupt, sharp downside reversals, it is critical that the long-biased position is structured so that the worst-case loss is limited. For this reason, O’Shea would never be outright long in a bubble market, but instead would express a bullish posture through a position such as a long call, a trade in which the maximum risk is defined by the premium paid for the option. Low volatility bubble markets are especially well attuned to being traded via long calls.

Although macro trades are typically based on a fundamental market view, there does not always have to be a reason for the trade. Sometimes, the market price action itself can reveal that something important is going on, even if the fundamental reason is not apparent. O’Shea experienced this situation in the course of LTCM’s demise, an event that strongly impacted most markets. Although O’Shea did not know the reason for the market action at the time, he reasoned that the magnitude of the move implied there was an important fundamental development, and he adjusted his positions accordingly. He quotes George Soros on this concept: Invest first; investigate later.

Many of the traders I have interviewed have emphasized the importance of a disciplined money management plan. O’Shea provides an insightful, more nuanced view. O’Shea explains that money management discipline could even be counterproductive if it is inconsistent with the underlying trade analysis. Many traders have the discipline to set stops and stick with them, but make the critical mistake of determining the stop points as pain thresholds rather than price levels that disprove their original trade premise. When they get stopped out, they still believe the original trade idea was correct. As a result, there will be a strong temptation to get back into the trade, leading to multiple losses on the same idea. The money management discipline may prevent a single large loss, but if the stop point is inconsistent with the trade analysis, it may not prevent a cumulative loss that is even larger. O’Shea’s advice is first decide where you are wrong, and then set the stop. If the stop implies a larger loss than you are comfortable taking on a single trade, then size the position correspondingly smaller. Using this approach, if the market reaches the stop point, it will be consistent with your own beliefs that the original trade premise was wrong.

One common theme that seems to underlie almost all the trades that O’Shea discussed in this chapter is that they are structured to be right skewed—that is, the maximum loss is limited, but the upside is open-ended. Long options, long CDS protection, and long the TED spread are all examples of trades in which the maximum loss is constrained.5

1The derivatives normally used to express directional and relative value exposure in global macro (e.g., futures, FX, options, swaps) require only a small capital outlay (as margin or premium) relative to the face value exposure.

2The passage that O’Shea refers to is the following:

I think it was a long step forward in my education when I realized at last that when old Mr. Partridge kept on telling the other customers, “Well, you know this is a bull market!” he really meant to tell them that the big money was not in the individual fluctuations but in the main movement—that is, not in reading the tape but in sizing up the entire market and its trend.

3Readers unfamiliar with options may wish to first review Appendix B, which provides a brief summary of option basics.

4Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) is the official designation of regulated managers who trade the futures markets. The majority of these managers use trend-following systems to generate trades.

5Maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for long options, the annual payments for long CDS protection, and zero for the TED spread (since it would be virtually impossible for the T-bill rate to be higher than the LIBOR rate).

## Chapter 2
`Ray Dalio`
### The Man Who Loves Mistakes

Ray Dalio is the founder, CIO, former CEO, and current mentor (the title he assumed in July 2011) of Bridgewater, the world’s largest hedge fund. As of December 2011, Bridgewater had $120 billion in assets under management and more than 1,400 employees. Bridgewater is unique in many ways beyond its size:

It has made more money for its investors than any other hedge fund in history—an estimated $50 billion over the past 20 years.
Bridgewater’s flagship fund has a near zero correlation to traditional markets.
Bridgewater’s flagship fund also has a very low correlation to other hedge funds.
The flagship fund uses the relatively rare combination of a fundamentally based systematic approach. (Most hedge funds that are fundamentally based use a discretionary approach, and most hedge funds that use systematic approaches base them on technical input.)
Bridgewater fosters an unusual corporate culture that encourages criticism among employees, regardless of rank.
Virtually all of Bridgewater’s business is institutional (95 percent institutional, 5 percent fund of funds).
Bridgewater is among a small minority of funds with a 20-year track record.
Bridgewater was the first hedge fund to create separate alpha and beta funds that could be combined in any mix desired by the client.
The track record for Bridgewater’s flagship strategy encompasses both managed accounts and funds, with each trading at multiple target volatility levels and multiple currencies. The 18 percent volatility strategy has achieved an average annual compounded net return of 14.8 percent (22.3 percent gross) over a near 20-year period, with an annualized standard deviation of 14.6 percent (16.0 percent on gross return data). The most impressive aspect of Bridgewater’s performance has been the firm’s ability to generate strong returns on huge assets under management. It is one thing for a hedge fund strategy to achieve strong return/risk performance on $50 million, or $500 million, or even $5 billion, but to do so on $50 billion is truly astounding. (Fifty billion dollars is the approximate assets under management Bridgewater had in its Pure Alpha strategy during 2010 when it recorded its highest annual return ever.)

Ray Dalio is a big picture thinker. Question: What one word might best describe Dalio’s view of an economic model based on a thorough analysis of the entire 67-year post–World War II U.S. economy? Answer: Myopic. Dalio describes his approach as “timeless and universal.” He believes an economic model should encompass multiple times and countries. Bridgewater employs a fundamentally based computer model that incorporates trading rules gleaned from both Dalio’s four decades of market observations as well as Bridgewater’s analysis of markets going back hundreds of years and spanning a broad range of developed and emerging economies.

Dalio named his flagship fund Pure Alpha to differentiate it from the majority of hedge funds he considers primarily beta vehicles. Dalio has been critical of hedge funds that derive most of their return from beta, but charge the higher fees associated with hedge funds on their entire return, even though the beta-derived portion can be duplicated by passive long investments. Beta measures how much an investment varies given changes in a benchmark market (e.g., S&P 500). Essentially, beta-based returns are returns that are earned by assuming various risks, most commonly market direction risk.1 In contrast, alpha refers to skill-based returns, which by definition are not correlated to any market or risk factor. The name of Bridgewater’s flagship fund, Pure Alpha, leaves little doubt as to the type of return it seeks to capture. True to its name, Pure Alpha has had near zero correlation to equities and fixed income and very low correlation (0.10) to hedge funds.

Bridgewater also has a beta-based strategy, All Weather, which has an objective of delivering beta returns in a portfolio mix that is balanced so that it will do well in different market environments. In 2009, Bridgewater launched All Weather II, which is a constrained version of All Weather that limits “safe” environment investments when the firm’s “depression gauge” indicator is activated.

The idea that the same fundamentals would have different implications under different circumstances and environments is an essential component of Dalio’s analytical thinking. As a result, categorization is an important tool for both conceptualizing problems and finding solutions. One example of category-based thinking is what I would call quadrant conceptualization—two key factors and two states provide four possible conditions. Bridgewater’s beta fund, the All Weather Fund, provides an example of this type of thinking. The fund combines two factors—growth and inflation—and two states—increasing and decreasing—and comes up with four conditions:

1. Growth increasing
2. Growth decreasing
3. Inflation increasing
4. Inflation decreasing
This four-part categorization reflects Dalio’s view that changes in expected growth and expected inflation are the dominant reasons that some asset classes do well when others do poorly. The fund’s strategy is to balance the portfolio with investments that do well in each of the above four environments. In contrast, most conventional portfolios substantially overweight assets that do well in the first category (i.e., growth-increasing environment), leading to unbalanced portfolios that can do poorly in other types of environments.

Another example of quadrant conceptualization is the way Dalio categorizes the economic outlook for different countries. Here he divides the world into two types of countries—creditors and debtors—and he defines two key distinguishing characteristics for each—countries that can exercise independent monetary policy and those that can’t. So there are four classifications of countries:

1. Debtor countries with independent monetary policy (e.g., U.S., U.K.).
2. Debtor countries without independent monetary policy (e.g., Greece, Portugal).
3. Creditor countries with independent monetary policy (e.g., Brazil).
4. Creditor countries without independent monetary policy (e.g., China because it pegs its currency to the dollar, which impedes its ability to raise interest rates).
Dalio loves mistakes because he believes that mistakes provide learning experiences that are the catalyst for improvement. The concept that mistakes are the path to progress is one of the pillars of Dalio’s life philosophy and the Bridgewater culture. Dalio is almost reverential in his comments about mistakes:

I learned that there is an incredible beauty to mistakes because embedded in each mistake is a puzzle and a gem that I could get if I solved it, i.e., a principle that I could use to reduce my mistakes in the future. I learned that each mistake was probably a reflection of something that I was (or others were) doing wrong, so if I could figure out what that was, I could learn how to be more effective. . . . While most others seem to believe that mistakes are bad things, I believe mistakes are good things because I believe that most learning comes via making mistakes and reflecting on them.

Dalio has set down his life philosophy and management concepts in Principles, a 111-page document that defines the Bridgewater culture and is required reading for employees. Principles is divided in two sections, the first, which Dalio calls “My Most Fundamental Principles,” and the second, a resulting compendium of 277 management rules. Not surprisingly, many of the management rules focus on mistakes. A sampling:

Recognize that mistakes are good if they result in learning.
Create a culture in which it is okay to fail but unacceptable not to identify, analyze, and learn from mistakes.
We must bring mistakes into the open and analyze them objectively, so managers need to foster a culture that makes this normal and penalizes suppressing or covering up mistakes—highlighting them, diagnosing them, thinking about what should be done differently in the future and then adding that new knowledge to the procedures manual are all essential to our improvement.
Recognize that you will certainly make mistakes and have weaknesses; so will those around you and those who work for you. What matters is how you deal with them. If you treat mistakes as learning opportunities that can yield rapid improvement if handled well, you will be excited by them.
If you don’t mind being wrong on the way to being right, you will learn a lot.
If improvement through mistakes is one of the two core concepts in Principles, “radical transparency” is the other. Employees are encouraged to be extremely transparent, not tolerate dishonesty, criticize each other without reservation, or “let loyalty stand in the way of truth and openness.” Managers are instructed not to talk about subordinates unless they are in the room. Virtually all meetings at Bridgewater are taped and made available to employees. Dalio leaves little doubt about his views on the topic of openness and honesty. For example, Management Rule #11 in Principles states: “Never say anything about a person you wouldn’t say to him directly. If you do, you’re a slimy weasel . . . ”

Many of the rules in Principles actually are well aligned with the key characteristics required for trading success. As one example, the following admonition from Principles about the importance of accepting responsibility would fit equally well in a manual for successful trading:

People who blame bad outcomes on anyone or anything other than themselves are behaving in a way that is at variance with reality and subversive to their progress.

I interviewed Dalio at his Bridgewater office, which is cantilevered over the Saugatuck River, with views of the surrounding woods, providing a bucolic work setting. Dalio tends to think in terms of interconnections rather than linearly, which can lead to rambling answers, as he readily acknowledges, “I see things in complex ways, and I have a problem communicating my way of seeing to others.” As the allotted time for the interview approached its end, Dalio abruptly pronounced, “Okay, we’re done.”

As the world’s largest hedge fund, you have come quite far. I wonder what your goals were as a young man?

I played around in the markets when I was a kid. I started when I was just 12. It was like a game, and I loved the game. The fact that I could make money playing the game was good, too, but it wasn’t what motivated me. I never had any specific goals like making or managing some level of money.

It is amazing how many of the successful traders I have interviewed got started in the markets at a very young age—their teens and sometimes even younger.

That makes total sense to me because the way people think is very much influenced by what they do early in their lives. Internalized learning is easiest when we are young, which is why learning to play a sport or to speak a language well is easier at an early age. The type of thinking that is necessary to succeed in the markets is entirely different from the type of thinking that is required to succeed in school. I’m sure that my being involved in the markets from an early age profoundly affected my way of thinking.

How so?

Most school education is a matter of following instructions—remember this; give it back; did you get the right answer? It teaches you that mistakes are bad instead of teaching you the importance of learning from mistakes. It doesn’t address how to deal with what you don’t know. Anyone who has been involved in the markets knows that you can never be absolutely confident. There is never a trade that you know you are right on. If you approach trading that way, then you will always be looking at where you might be wrong. You don’t have a false confidence. You value what you don’t know. In order for me to form an opinion about anything involves a higher threshold than if I were involved in some profession other than trading. I’m so worried that I may be wrong that I work really hard at putting my ideas out in front of other people for them to shoot down and tell me where I may be wrong. That process helps me be right. You have to be both assertive and open-minded at the same time. The markets teach you that you have to be an independent thinker. And any time you are an independent thinker, there is a reasonable chance you are going to be wrong.

How did you get involved in the stock market as a child?

When I was a kid in the 1960s, just about everyone was talking about the stock market, more so than at any other time, even including during the tech bubble. I remember getting a haircut and discussing stocks with my barber. I earned some money caddying; I got paid $6 per bag, and I carried two bags at one time. I used that money to open an account. My father introduced me to his retail broker. He barely invested in stocks, but at the time, everyone had a retail broker.

Do you remember your first trade?

Yes, I bought Northeast Airlines, which flew between New York and Florida.

How did you pick that stock?

It was the only stock I had ever heard of that was also selling below $5 a share. So I could buy more shares. That was my whole analysis. It didn’t make any sense, but I got lucky. The company was about to go bankrupt, but then it was acquired, and I tripled my money. So I figured this was easy. I don’t remember anything more about any specific stocks I bought as a child. But what I do remember is that when I was about 18 years old, we had the first bear market in my experience, and I learned to go short. Then in college I got involved in trading commodities.

What attracted you to commodities?

I could trade them with low margin requirements. I figured that with low margin requirements, I could make more money.

Any early experiences in the markets stand out?

In 1971, after graduating college and before going to business school, I had a job as a clerk on the New York Stock Exchange. On August 15, Nixon took the U.S. off the gold standard, and the monetary system broke down. I remember the stock market then went up a lot, which is certainly not what I expected.

What did you learn from that experience?

I learned that currency depreciations and the printing of money are good for stocks. I also learned not to trust what policy makers say. I learned these lessons repeatedly over the years.

Any other early experiences stand out where the market behaved very differently from what you expected?

In 1982, we had worse economic conditions than we do right now. The unemployment rate was over 11 percent. It also seemed clear to me that Latin America was going to default on its debt. Since I knew that the money center banks had large amounts of their capital in Latin American debt, I assumed that a default would be terrible for the stock market. Then boom—in August, Mexico defaulted. The market responded with a big rally. In fact, that was the exact bottom of the stock market and the beginning of an 18-year bull market. That is certainly not what I would have expected to happen. That rally occurred because the Fed eased massively. I learned not to fight the Fed unless I had very good reasons to believe that their moves wouldn’t work. The Fed and other central banks have tremendous power. In both the abandonment of the gold standard in 1971 and in the Mexico default in 1982, I learned that a crisis development that leads to central banks easing and coming to the rescue can swamp the impact of the crisis itself.

Any other events stand out as learning experiences?

Every day provides tactile learning experiences. You are asking me to describe moments. I don’t see it as moments, but rather as a string of tactile experiences. It is not so much a matter of cerebral memories as it is visceral feelings. You can read about what happened in the market after Mexico defaulted, but that is not the same as being in the market and actually experiencing it. I particularly remember my surprises, especially the painful ones, because those are the experiences that provide learning lessons.

I vividly remember being long pork bellies in my personal account in the early 1970s at a time when pork bellies were limit down every day.2 I didn’t know when my losses would end, and I was worried that I would be financially ruined. In those days, we had the big commodity boards, which clicked whenever prices changed. So each morning, on the opening, I would see and hear the market click down 200 points, the daily limit, stay unchanged at that price, and know that I had lost that much more, with the amount of potential additional losses still undefined. It was a very tactile experience.

What did you learn from that experience?

It taught me the importance of risk controls because I never wanted to experience that pain again. It enhanced my fear of being wrong and taught me to make sure that no single bet, or even multiple bets, could cause me to lose more than an acceptable amount. In trading you have to be defensive and aggressive at the same time. If you are not aggressive, you are not going to make money, and if you are not defensive, you are not going to keep money. I believe that anyone who has made money in trading has had to experience horrendous pain at some point. Trading is like working with electricity; you can get an electric shock. With that pork belly trade and other trades, I felt the electric shock and the fear that comes with it. That led to my attitude: Let me show you what I think, and please knock the hell out of it. I learned about the math of investing.

[Dalio walks over to the board and draws a diagram where the horizontal axis represents the number of investments and the vertical axis the standard deviation.]

This is a chart that I teach people in the firm, which I call the Holy Grail of investing.

[He then draws a curve that slopes down from left to right—that is, the greater the number of assets, the lower the standard deviation.]

This chart shows how the volatility of the portfolio changes as you add assets. If you add assets that have a 0.60 correlation to the other assets, the risk will go down by about 15 percent as you add more assets, but that’s about it, even if you add a thousand assets. If you run a long-only equity portfolio, you can diversify to a thousand stocks and it will only reduce the risk by about 15 percent, since the average stock has about a 0.60 correlation to another stock. If, however, you’re combining assets that have an average of zero correlation, then by the time you diversify to only 15 assets, you can cut the volatility by 80 percent. Therefore, by holding uncorrelated assets, I can improve my return/risk ratio by a factor of five through diversification.

What about the problem of markets becoming highly correlated? As we sit here today, if you tell me that the S&P is down 2 percent, I can tell you the direction of virtually every other market.

I don’t think that’s correct.

Really, you don’t think that’s true?

I think that’s only true because of the way you are defining markets. For example, I can’t tell you which way the Greek/Irish bond spread would move in response to the S&P being down. There are ways to structure your trades so that you can produce a whole bunch of uncorrelated bets. You have to start with your goal. My goal is that I want to trade more than 15 uncorrelated assets. You are just telling me your problem, and it’s not an insurmountable problem. I strive for approximately 100 different return streams that are roughly uncorrelated to each other. There are cross-correlations that enter into it, so the number works out to be less than 100, but it is well over 15. Correlation doesn’t exist the way most people think it exists.

What do you mean by that?

People think that a thing called correlation exists. That’s wrong. What is really happening is that each market is behaving logically based on its own determinants, and as the nature of those determinants changes, what we call correlation changes. For example, when economic growth expectations are volatile, stocks and bonds will be negatively correlated because if growth slows, it will cause both stock prices and interest rates to decline. However, in an environment where inflation expectations are volatile, stocks and bonds will be positively correlated because interest rates will go up with higher inflation, which is detrimental to both bonds and stocks. So both relationships are totally logical, even though they are exact opposites of each other. If you try to represent the stock/bond relationship with one correlation statistic, it denies the causality of the correlation.

Correlation is just the word people use to take an average of how two prices have behaved together. When I am setting up my trading bets, I am not looking at correlation; I am looking at whether the drivers are different. I am choosing 15 or more assets that behave differently for logical reasons. I may talk about the return streams in the portfolio being uncorrelated, but be aware that I’m not using the term correlation the way most people do. I am talking about the causation, not the measure.

There has been some press recently about the culture at Bridgewater. How would you describe it?

The Bridgewater culture seeks truth by encouraging independent thinking and innovation in an environment of radical transparency. We recognize that there must be thoughtful disagreement and non-ego-impaired explorations of mistakes and weaknesses to achieve our goals. It is a culture in which people hold each other to very high standards and are completely honest with each other, while still being extremely considerate. It is a culture that values truth and transparency so much that we record almost all discussions so there can’t be any spin.

I think that one of the greatest problems that plagues mankind is that people are always saying, “I think this, and I think that,” when there is a high probability they are wrong. After all, to the extent that there is strong disagreement about an issue, a lot of the people must be wrong. Yet most of them are totally confident they are right. How is that possible? Imagine how much better almost all decision making would be if people who disagree were less confident and more open to trying to get at the truth through thoughtful discourse. Anyway, that’s the approach that works well for us.

When there is a disagreement between you and Bridgewater employees whose opinion you respect, how is the difference of opinion resolved?

We reach resolutions by questioning each other, which leads to better understanding. You say that. Why do you say that? What is the evidence? What do we need to look at? How can we resolve the difference? Who do we need to bring in to facilitate the conversation and help us move forward? And so on. That process produces discovery, and that’s fantastic. If there is a disagreement about something that is to be built into our investment decision-making process, then the three chief investment officers would have to concur [Dalio, and co-CIOs Bob Prince and Greg Jensen]. By and large, we will almost always reach an agreement. If we didn’t reach an agreement, we wouldn’t make any change.

Does that imply that every time you take a position in the markets, all the key people have agreed on that position?

No. Our decision-making process is to determine the criteria by which we make decisions in the market. Those criteria—I call them principles—are systematized. These principles determine what we do under different circumstances. In other words, we make decisions about the criteria we use to make decisions. We don’t make decisions about individual positions.

For any trading strategy, we can look back at when it won, when it lost, and under what circumstances. Each strategy develops a track record that we deeply understand and then combine in a portfolio of diversified strategies. If a strategy is not performing in real time as expected, we can reevaluate it, and if we agree it is desirable, we might modify our systems. We have been doing this for 36 years. Over the years, we develop new understandings, which we continually add to our existing understandings.

You have had only two drawdowns worse than 12 percent in 20 years with the worst being 20 percent. How have you managed to keep your drawdowns so controlled using a directional strategy?

There are two parts to the answer. First, as we discussed earlier, we balance risk across multiple independent drivers. We avoid having too much of the portfolio concentrated in any single driver. Second, we have stress-tested our strategies through multiple time frames and multiple scenarios.

I think many people experience drawdowns that are much larger than they expected because they never really understood how their strategy would have worked in different environments. There are managers who have been in the business for five years and think, I have a great track record; this approach really works. But they really don’t have the perspective of how their strategy would have performed in different circumstances. Strategies that are based on a manager’s recent experience will work until they inevitably don’t work.

In contrast, we test our criteria to make sure that they are timeless and universal. Timeless means that we look at a strategy during all different times, and universal means that we look at how a strategy worked in all different countries. There is no reason why a strategy’s effectiveness should change in different time periods or when you go from country to country. This broad analysis through time and geography gives us a unique perspective relative to most other managers. For example, to understand the current U.S. zero interest rate, deleveraging environment, we need to understand what happened a long time ago, such as the 1930s, and in other countries, such as Japan in the postbubble era. Deleveragings are very different from recessions. Aside from the ongoing deleveraging, there are no other deleveragings in the U.S. post–World War II period.

Are there risk limits in terms of individual positions?

There are limits in terms of position size, but not in terms of price. We don’t use stops. We trade approximately 150 different markets, where I am using the term market to also mean spread positions, as well as individual markets. However, at any given time, we probably have only about 20 or so significant positions, which account for about 80 percent of the risk and are uncorrelated to each other.

When you are in a significant drawdown, do you do anything differently? Do you reduce your exposure?

I don’t believe in reducing exposures when you have a losing position. I want to be clear about that. The only pertinent question is whether my being in a losing position is a statistically meaningful indicator of what the subsequent price movement will be. And it is not. For that reason, I don’t alter positions because they are losing.

Is the implication that whether you are at a new high or you are down 15 percent, you will still size positions exactly the same way?

Yes, the positions taken and their size would be exactly the same.

If a position works poorly, does that cause you to reexamine your strategy?

Always. The best discoveries come from positions that don’t work out. For example, in 1994, we were long a number of bond markets, and the bond markets sold off. We have multiple rules and systems that apply to the bond markets, and at the time, they indicated a net long position for each bond market. Afterward, we realized that if we took those same systems and traded them on a spread basis rather than an absolute basis, we could produce a much better return/risk outcome. That change took advantage of the universal truth that you can enhance the return/risk ratio by reducing correlation. If there is a research insight, we change our process.

That is an example of how a losing position caused you to change your process. But what about an individual position that is losing money? I understand that you do not get out or reduce a position simply because it is losing money, but what if you change your mind because you realize that you overlooked some factor or didn’t give some factor enough weight?

No, it doesn’t work that way. The way we change our minds is a function of how that information passes through our decision rules. Our decision rules determine the position direction and size under the circumstances.

So your trading process is fully systematized rather than dependent on discretionary decisions?

It is 99 percent systematized. These systems evolve, however, as the experience we gain might prompt us to change or add rules. But we don’t make discretionary trading decisions on 99 percent of our individual positions.

What if there is some idiosyncratic event that is not incorporated in the system?

If it is something like the World Trade Center getting knocked down, then yes, we may exercise a discretionary override. In most cases, such discretion would be a matter of reducing risk exposure. I would say probably less than 1 percent of trades might be affected by discretion.

Is your process totally fundamentally driven, or does the system also include technical factors?

There are no technical inputs.

So in contrast to the majority of CTAs who use a systematic approach based only on technical factors, primarily or solely price, you also use a systematic approach, but one based on only fundamental factors.

That’s right.

What is the origin of the Bridgewater system?

Beginning around 1980, I developed a discipline that whenever I put on a trade, I would write down the reasons on a pad. When I liquidated the trade, I would look at what actually happened and compare it with my reasoning and expectations when I put on the trade. Learning solely from actual experience, however, is inadequate because it takes too much time to get a representative sample to determine whether a decision rule works. I discovered that I could backtest the criteria that I wrote down to get a good perspective of how they would have performed and to refine them. The next step was to define decision rules based on the criteria. I required the decision rules to be logically based and was careful to avoid data mining. That’s how the Bridgewater system began and developed in the early years. That same process continued and was improved with the help of many others over the years.

Are the individual rules in the compendium of rules that make up the Bridgewater system sometimes revised or do they remain static through time?

They are sometimes revised. For example, we used to look at how changes in the oil price affected countries. Between the first oil shock and the second oil shock in the 1970s, crude oil was discovered in the North Sea, and the U.K. went from being a net importer to a net exporter. That event prompted us to change how we configured the decision rule that related to oil prices so that when the mix of export and import items changed, the rule changed.

How are you able to manage such a large amount of money without substantially impeding your performance? In fact, in 2010, you managed to achieve your highest return ever, despite having your largest assets under management ever. Most hedge funds end up having size-related difficulties managing much smaller sums.

There are two major differences between us and most other hedge funds. Most hedge funds trade fewer markets, and they trade much more actively. We trade virtually every liquid market in the world, so the amount we have committed to any single market is small relative to our total equity. We also change our positions slowly. As you know, transaction costs are a function of the amount you have to move in a given time frame. Therefore, we have considerably more capacity than managers who trade fewer markets and turn their positions over more quickly.

What is your turnover rate per market, per year?

It depends what you mean by turnover rate. If you are defining turnover as moving from net long to net short rather than changes in magnitude, then the average time length is about 12 to 18 months.

So it is a very slow process.

Yes, on average.

What about a year like 2008 when markets are witnessing huge price swings in a matter of days?

In some years, the turnover rate might be significantly greater than in others, though in 2008, it wasn’t much above the average. I believe you are thinking that we would be trading more during a volatile period, but that’s not necessarily true. Our trades are driven directly by fundamentals and only indirectly by price to the extent that price changes make a market cheaper or more expensive.

I guess then that another reason why size may not be as much of an issue as might be surmised based on your huge assets under management is that you will have a tendency to be a seller when the market is heavily bid and a buyer when it is heavily offered.

While that is often the case, it wouldn’t be true if the fundamentals were changing faster. We will trade in the opposite direction of the price movement if all the fundamentals remain unchanged. For example, if prices fall and the fundamentals didn’t change, we would be buyers. But in practice, the fundamentals are also changing. So the direction of our trades will depend on both changes in fundamentals and changes in price.

But in a period like fall 2008 when markets were witnessing huge swings in a matter of days largely based on shifts in sentiment rather than changes in fundamentals, I assume you would be more likely to be going in the opposite direction of most traders. Whereas most traders would be selling to cut their exposure when a market was breaking sharply, you would more likely be a buyer and have lots of liquidity.

That’s right, as long as there wasn’t a bearish shift in the fundamentals as well.

Do you ever run into situations where size is an issue?

No, because we make sure that we do not run into the problem of size being an issue. We know our transaction costs very well, and we know how long it takes for us to get in and out of positions. We will limit our position size to assure that we can get out reasonably quickly and to keep our transaction costs small relative to the expected alpha of the trades in that market.

Is there a limitation as to how large you can allow the fund to grow?

Yes, we have been closed for several years.

But even if you are closed, in a year like 2010, your assets can grow dramatically just from profits.

We returned profits.

You did quite well in 2008, a difficult year for many hedge funds. What do you attribute your favorable 2008 performance to?

Our criteria for trading in a deleveraging had already been established because we had previously studied other leveragings and deleveragings. Our analysis included both inflationary deleveragings, such as Germany in the 1920s and Latin America in the 1980s, and deflationary deleveragings, such as the Great Depression of the 1930s and Japan in the 1990s. I had also directly experienced the deleveragings in Latin America and Japan. We felt that if these sort of big events had happened before, they could happen again. We also believed that fully comprehending these events was important to understanding how economies and markets worked.

Eight years before the deleveraging that began in 2008, we had developed and implemented what we call a depression gauge. It was designed to indicate when a depression-like environment was in effect based on a number of conditions coinciding, such as interest rates below a certain low level, contractions in private credit growth, a declining stock market, and widening credit spreads. We knew that when the depression gauge was on, we would have fewer reliable indicators, with some indicators being impacted more than others. For example, if interest rates are near zero, obviously, they can no longer be used as a viable indicator. We ran simulations of how our systems would have performed through both inflationary and deflationary deleveragings. If the depression gauge is triggered, our system rules and risk constraints are adjusted to fit the circumstances of a deleveraging period.

It was obvious in 2008 that investors were heavily leveraged in carry trade positions—that is, they had bought higher-yielding assets funded by shorting lower-yielding assets. These positions would have to be unwound when the credit bubble popped. We also could see that the banks had leveraged up rapidly and carelessly. We anticipated they would have large losses because, by reviewing their 10Ks, we knew the types of positions they held. By applying indicative pricings, we could mark their balance sheets to the market, which gave us insights into the negative implications for the economy and other markets. In short, by knowing how deleveragings occur, we could monitor the appropriate factors, and by understanding the cause-and-effect relationships in a deleveraging, it was not difficult to be well positioned in 2008.

Besides being well prepared to trade through a deleveraging, we also didn’t have the same vulnerability to a year like 2008, as most hedge funds did, simply because the inherent structure of our Pure Alpha strategy avoids embedded betas. In contrast, most hedge funds mix betas and alpha. The truth about hedge funds is that much of what is packaged as alpha is really beta sold at alpha prices. The average hedge fund is about 70 percent correlated with stocks. Why are most hedge funds so skewed toward strategies that do well in good times? I think it is human nature for people to choose strategies that worked well during the recent past, which implies a long bias.

What is your big picture perspective of the current difficult economic situation facing the U.S.?

Currently, we have a situation where there is a broad global deleveraging, which is negative for growth. Debtor countries that can print money will behave differently from those that can’t. Countries that can’t print money will experience classic deflationary depressions. Those that can print money, such as the United States, can alleviate the deflation and depression pressures by printing money. However, the effectiveness of quantitative easing will be limited because the owners of the bonds that are purchased by the Fed will use the money to buy something similar; they are not going to use it to buy a house or a car. In addition, fiscal stimulus will be very limited because of the reality of the political situation. So it is unlikely that we will have effective monetary policy or effective fiscal policy. That means we will be dependent on income growth, and income growth will be slow—maybe about 2 percent per year—because income growth is usually dependent on debt growth to finance buying, and I don’t expect any significant private credit growth. A growth rate of 2 percent is not sufficient to meaningfully lower the unemployment rate. There is a risk that if the economy deteriorates, we won’t have any effective tools for reversing the situation. The current situation is analogous to being in a recession and not being able to lower interest rates.

If you had the power to enact policy, is there any policy that could ameliorate the current situation?

The best policy would be to spread out the problems over a long period of time so that nominal interest rates stay below nominal growth rates.

How do you do that?

You do it through a combination of monetary and fiscal policies that produce enough government spending to make up for the reduction in private sector spending to keep the economy from contracting. Avoiding an unmanaged contraction is essential in order to maintain social and political order. At the same time, there needs to be well thought-out debt restructurings because we can no longer allow our debts to rise faster than our incomes, and we need to gradually lower them.

If you do more fiscal spending, it would further increase the debt. We are dependent on foreign capital to buy our debt. Isn’t there a risk that increasing the debt further through fiscal stimulus might scare away foreign buyers of U.S bonds?

There sure is. That is why it is very important that the fiscal spending is used for investments that generate returns that are greater than their costs. We can’t afford to waste money.

Do you mean the spending should be focused on things such as infrastructure?

Yes, put idle people to work on useful projects. It is also socially good. I think it is very bad for society for people to be out of work for very long periods.

It is also a false saving. You are paying unemployed workers unemployment insurance and providing other safety net expenditures, and generating nothing in return. Whereas if you pay people to build bridges and repair roads, at least you’re getting something out of it, and it has a multiplier effect.

That’s right. I don’t like the giving-money-away option because it will devalue the currency and cause investors to run away from U.S. assets. The government should try to make the expenditures a good investment.

Do you see a danger of the printing of money leading to inflation risk?

Not over the next couple of years. However, longer term, whenever a country has a balance of payments deficit and depends on foreign capital, there is a risk that foreign investors will pull back if they fear currency weaknesses as a result of the increased printing of money. The first sign of such a shift is a shortening of the duration of bonds bought by foreigners, which further tightens credit. Such a response occurred in 1931 to 1933 when interest rates went up, even though we were in a deflationary depression. Under these circumstances, the central bank will normally buy more bonds to make up for the difference, which is a monetization of the debt that causes the currency to weaken and a movement of money into real assets and other currencies to escape currency weakness. This phase usually takes a couple of years. Initially, there is a move from deflation to a low level of inflation. For example, when Roosevelt decided to print money and go off the gold standard in 1933, the move depreciated the dollar and just negated the deflation; it didn’t bring about a high level of inflation. During such times, both gold and bonds can go up together, which is very different from a normal situation in which higher gold prices imply lower bond prices because of the inflation component. This pattern is exactly what has happened in the current cycle when we have had monetary easing and seen both gold and bonds go up.

When I read your description of long-term cycles, it sounded like the U.S. had gone through the fourth of the five phases—a country that still thinks it is rich, but isn’t—and is now in the fifth stage: a country in decline. Is that an accurate interpretation of your views?

I believe so.

How long does this cycle typically last?

The entire cycle takes about 100 to 150 years; the fifth phase of a cycle (decline) lasts for about 20 years.

Assuming the U.S. entered its decline phase around 2008, your cyclical model implies the U.S. can remain in a general decline out to 2130. That is a pretty pessimistic outlook. Have there been any situations of countries in the decline phase of the long-term cycle where it hasn’t been extremely painful?

The decline of the British Empire after World War II wasn’t cataclysmic because the adjustment process was spread out over many years. So was Japan’s deleveraging. Essentially a country’s conditions can stay about the same for a very long period. It doesn’t have to be terrible. But it can be terrible if it is badly managed.

At Bridgewater, criticism is encouraged, including subordinates criticizing superiors. Do any of your employees ever criticize you?

All the time.

Can you give me an example?

I was in a client meeting with a big European pension fund that was visiting managers in Connecticut. After the meeting, the salesperson criticized me for being inarticulate, running on too long, and adversely affecting the meeting. I asked others who had been at the meeting for their opinions. I was given a grade of “F” by one of our new analysts who was just one year out of school. I loved it because I knew they were helping me improve and that they understood that was what they were supposed to be doing.

What do you believe is the biggest mistake people make in investing?

The biggest mistake investors make is to believe that what happened in the recent past is likely to persist. They assume that something that was a good investment in the recent past is still a good investment. Typically, high past returns simply imply that an asset has become more expensive and is a poorer, not better, investment. The tendency of investors to buy after a price increase for no reasons other than the price increase itself causes prices to overshoot. When investors are making money because they’re greedy and fearless, which is typically after a large price rise, doing the opposite is a good idea.

Dalio is a strong believer in diversification. In fact, he calls the potential improvement in return/risk through the addition of uncorrelated assets the “Holy Grail of investing.” He states that return/risk can be improved by as much as a factor of 5 to 1 if the assets in the portfolio are truly independent.

Most people tend to focus on correlation as a primary tool for determining the relative dependence or independence of two assets. Dalio believes that correlation can be a misleading statistic and poorly suited as a tool for constructing a diversified portfolio. The crux of the problem is that correlations between assets are highly variable and critically dependent on prevailing circumstances. For example, typically, gold and bonds are inversely related because inflation (current or expected) will be bullish for gold and negative for bonds (because higher inflation normally implies higher interest rates). In the early phases of a deleveraging cycle, however, both gold and bonds can move higher together, as aggressive monetary easing will reduce interest rates (i.e., increase bond prices), while at the same time enhancing longer-term concerns over currency depreciation, which will increase gold prices. In this type of environment, gold and bonds can be positively correlated, which is exactly opposite their normal relationship.

Instead of using correlation as a measure of dependence between positions, Dalio focuses on the underlying drivers that are expected to affect those positions. Drivers are the cause; correlations are the consequence. In order to ensure a diversified portfolio, it is necessary to select assets that have different drivers. By determining the future drivers that are likely to impact each market, a forward-looking approach, Dalio can more accurately assess which positions are likely to move in the same direction or inversely—for example, anticipate when gold and bonds are likely to move in the same direction and when they are likely to move in opposite directions. In contrast, making decisions based on correlation, which is backward looking, can lead to faulty decisions in forming portfolios. Dalio constructs portfolios so that the different positions have different drivers rather than simply being uncorrelated.

Bridgewater makes heavy use of spread positions to create holdings that have different drivers. For example, even though different world bond markets may be exposed to similar drivers, various spread positions between those bonds can have different drivers. The use of spread positions is critical in mitigating the problem of highly synchronous behavior between positions in the portfolio in an investment environment that is characterized by shifts between “risk on” and “risk off” (a situation where a broad range of markets move in tandem in response to whether investors are risk-averse or risk-seeking).

Markets behave differently in different environments. The behavior of markets in deleveragings is very different from their responses in recessions. Any fundamental model that assumes static relationships between markets and economic variables will be flawed because those relationships can change dramatically in different market situations. For example, the same government actions that might lead to a sustained rebound in a recession might have little impact in a deleveraging. Dalio contends that any valid fundamental approach must be broad enough in scope—both temporal and geographical—to encompass all different environments. He believes such a “timeless and universal” approach is the only way to build a fundamental model that is sufficiently robust to represent the real world.

Investors are often baffled when markets respond to news events in counterintuitive fashion. Dalio vividly recalls these experiences when seemingly very bearish events, such as the United States coming off the gold standard in 1971 and the Mexican default in 1982, were to his great surprise followed by major market rallies. In part, this seemingly paradoxical market behavior can be explained by the fact that markets often anticipate the news. The other part of the explanation is that bearish events can trigger new events with bullish consequences. For example, developments that have very negative implications for the economy and investor sentiment can prompt central bank countermeasures that lead to rallies.

If there is a single essential lesson to learn from Dalio, it is that mistakes provide the path to improvement and ultimate success. Each mistake offers an opportunity to learn from the error and to modify one’s approach based on this new information. Whenever you make a significant mistake in trading, write it down, both to reinforce the lesson and to serve as a future reminder. Then change your trading process based on this new experience. In this way, mistakes can become the essential ingredient for continual improvement as a trader, or for that matter any other endeavor.

Addendum: Ray Dalio’s Big Picture View
Dalio’s big picture perspective applies not only to temporal and geographic breadth, but also to viewing the markets and economies through the lens of long-term cycles and trends. Dalio’s template for understanding economies consists of superimposing three forces that together explain the position and direction of any economy:

1. Productivity growth—Real per capita GDP in the United States has increased at an average rate of near 2 percent over the past 100 years as a result of productivity gains, but has fluctuated widely around this trend based on the prevailing long-term and business cycles.
2. Long-term credit expansion/deleveraging cycle—Initially, the availability of credit expands spending beyond income levels. As Dalio explains,
[This process] is self-reinforcing because rising spending generates rising incomes and rising net worths, which raise borrowers’ capacity to borrow, which allows more buying and spending. . . . The up-wave in the cycle typically goes on for decades, with variations in it primarily due to central banks tightening and easing credit (which makes business cycles).

Although self-reinforcing, the credit expansion phase ultimately reaches a point where it can no longer be extended. Dalio describes this transition in the credit cycle as follows:

It can’t go on forever. Eventually the debt service payments become equal to or larger than the amount we can borrow and the spending must decline. When promises to deliver money (debt) can’t rise any more relative to the money and credit coming in, the process works in reverse and we have deleveragings. Since borrowing is simply a way of pulling spending forward, the person spending $110,000 per year and earning $100,000 per year has to cut his spending to $90,000 for as many years as he spent $110,000, all else being equal. . . . In deleveragings, rather than debts rising relative to money as they do in up-waves, the reverse is true. As the money coming in to debtors via incomes and borrowings is not enough to meet debtors’ obligations, assets need to be sold and spending needs to be cut in order to raise cash. This leads asset values to fall, which reduces the value of collateral, and in turn reduces incomes. Because of both lower collateral values and lower incomes, borrowers’ creditworthiness is reduced, so they justifiably get less credit, and so it continues in a self-reinforcing manner.

Dalio emphasizes that deleveragings are very different from recessions:

Unlike in recessions, when cutting interest rates and creating more money can rectify this imbalance, in deleveragings monetary policy is ineffective in creating credit. In other words, in recessions (when monetary policy is effective) the imbalance between the amount of money and the need for it to service debt can be rectified because interest rates can be cut enough to (1) ease debt service burdens, (2) stimulate economic activity because monthly debt service payments are high relative to incomes, and (3) produce a positive wealth effect; however, in deleveragings, this can’t happen. In deflationary depressions/deleveragings, monetary policy is typically ineffective in creating credit because interest rates hit 0 percent and can’t be lowered further, so other, less-effective ways of increasing money are followed. Credit growth is difficult to stimulate because borrowers remain overindebted, making sensible lending impossible. In inflationary deleveragings, monetary policy is ineffective in creating credit because increased money growth goes into other currencies and inflation hedge assets because investors fear that their lending will be paid back with money of depreciated value.

3. Business cycle—The business cycle refers to fluctuations in economic activity. Dalio explains that “In the ‘business cycle,’ the availability and cost of credit are driven by central bankers, while in the ‘long wave cycle,’ the availability and cost of credit are driven by factors that are largely beyond central banks’ control.” In the standard business cycle, the central bank can boost a lagging economy by lowering interest rates. In the deleveraging phase of the long wave cycle, central banks can’t exert any influence by lowering rates because rates are already at or near zero.
It should now be clear why Dalio believes that any fundamental market analysis based solely on the entire post–World War II period in the United States is entirely inadequate. Although encompassing nearly 70 years, this period in the United States does not contain any deleveragings other than the current one that began in 2008. And, as explained, economies and markets behave very differently in deleveragings than in standard recessions. By focusing more broadly through both time and geography, Dalio is able to draw upon past instances that are comparable to the current situation (e.g., Great Depression, postbubble Japan, Latin American defaults).

In regard to the cycles that affect individual countries, Dalio takes an even broader perspective, measured in centuries, which he calls, appropriately enough, “the really big picture.” Dalio believes that all countries move through a five-phase cycle:

Stage 1—Countries are poor and think that they are poor.
Stage 2—Countries are getting rich quickly, but still think they are poor.
Stage 3—Countries are rich and think of themselves as rich.
Stage 4—Countries become poorer and still think of themselves as rich.
Stage 5—Countries go through deleveraging and relative decline, which they are slow to accept.
This is how Dalio describes countries in Stage 4:

This is the leveraging up phase—i.e., debts rise relative to incomes until they can’t anymore. . . . Because spending continues to be strong, they continue to appear rich, even though their balance sheets deteriorate. The reduced level of efficient investments in infrastructure, capital goods, and R&D slow their productivity gains. Their cities and infrastructures become older and less efficient than those in the two earlier stages. Their balance of payments positions deteriorate, reflecting their reduced competitiveness. They increasingly rely on their reputations rather than on their competitiveness to fund their deficits. They typically spend a lot of money on the military at this stage, sometimes very large amounts because of wars, in order to protect their global interests. Often, though not always, at the advanced stages of this phase, countries run “twin deficits”—i.e., both balance of payments and government deficits.

In the last few years of this stage, frequently bubbles occur. . . . These bubbles emerge because investors, businessmen, financial intermediaries, individuals, and policy makers tend to assume that the future will be like the past so they bet heavily on the trends continuing. They mistakenly believe that investments that have gone up a lot are good rather than expensive so they borrow money to buy them, which drives up their prices more and reinforces this bubble process. . . . Bubbles burst when the income growth and investment returns inevitably fall short of the levels required to service these debts. . . . The financial losses that result from the bubble bursting contribute to the country’s economic decline. Whether due to wars or bubbles or both, what typifies this stage is an accumulation of debt that can’t be paid back in non-depreciated money, which leads to the next stage.

And Stage 5:

After bubbles burst and when deleveragings occur, private debt growth, private sector spending, asset values, and net worths decline in a self-reinforcing negative cycle. To compensate, government debt growth, government deficits, and central bank “printing” of money typically increase. In this way, their central banks and central governments cut real interest rates and increase nominal GDP growth so that it is comfortably above nominal interest rates in order to ease debt burdens. As a result of these low real interest rates, weak currencies, and poor economic conditions, their debt and equity assets are poor performing and increasingly these countries have to compete with less expensive countries that are in the earlier stages of development. Their currencies depreciate and they like it. As an extension of these economic and financial trends, countries in this stage see their power in the world decline.

The foregoing Stage 4 and Stage 5 profiles sound like uncomfortably close descriptions of the United States (Stage 5—current situation; Stage 4 preceding decades), don’t they?

1Market direction is only one type of beta risk. Other examples of beta risks include credit risk, liquidity risk, and short volatility risk. Beta returns are returns earned by assuming risk, and these returns can be duplicated by various combinations of passive long investments. Over the long term, beta returns will be positive because investors have to be compensated for assuming these risks.

2Many futures markets have daily limits on the maximum permissible price move. If there was a large imbalance between buyers and sellers, such as might occur after the release of a surprisingly bullish or bearish government report, the market would open locked at the limit price because the equilibrium price would be outside the limit range. For example, if the price was 60 cents/lb., and the government released a report that made the market think prices should be at 50 cents, the decline would occur in daily steps of 2 cents because of price limits. On the first day, there would be lots of sellers, but virtually zero buyers, so the price would open and stay at 58 cents with no trading. Of course, when a market is locked in a sequence of limit moves, there is no way of knowing what the new equilibrium price will be—that is, where the market will trade freely.

## Chapter 3
`Larry Benedict`
### Beyond Three Strikes
The road to success is often paved with failure. Larry Benedict did two things consistently during his early career: lose money in trading and get fired—the two often, but not always, related. Despite a complete lack of evidence that he possessed any trading skill, Benedict persisted in his quest to become a successful trader, somehow managing to find another trading job after each failure. Luckily for Benedict, there is no three-strikes-and-you’re-out rule in pursuing a career.

Ultimately, Benedict proved to be as consistent in success as he was in failure. Benedict’s transition point came in 1989 when he was hired by Spear, Leeds & Kellogg (SLK) to be an option specialist in the XMI index on the American Stock Exchange. As a specialist, Benedict gained some much needed experience and developed a feel for the markets. When volume in the XMI started to dry up three years later, Benedict became an off-the-floor index derivatives trader for SLK. In 1993, Benedict’s success as a trader led to his being named the Special Limited Partner for SLK’s newly created proprietary trading department. After Goldman Sachs purchased SLK in 2000, Benedict left to start his own trading firm, Banyan Equity Management.

A trading friend describes Benedict’s skill in the market as follows: “He has ‘it.’ It’s hard to describe it. Why does Ichiro Suzuki repeatedly hit 350? I don’t know. Benedict is like Rain Man in that office, but get him out of the office, and he can’t even find his keys. In the office, he is like a friggen Maestro.”

Benedict is a very active short-term trader. He averages about 100 to 200 trades a day. Several years ago, the pace was even more frenetic: closer to 500 trades per day. His core market is the S&P 500. He also trades foreign equity indexes, such as the DAX, Hang Seng, and Nikkei, domestic and foreign interest rate markets, major currencies, and key commodity markets, such as crude oil and gold. The S&P 500 is the hub, and Benedict pays a lot of attention to how the other major markets are correlating (either directly or inversely) with the S&P 500. Benedict is essentially a mean reversion trader—that is, he will be a seller into short-term upswings and a buyer into short-term declines. The entry level of his trades will be determined by the prevailing volatility of the market, his directional bias, if any, and changes in correlations between the markets he trades. Benedict will also trade longs in one market versus shorts in a positively correlated market (or longs in an inversely correlated market) if he thinks the short-term price relationship is overextended. Benedict maintains the risk balance of a constantly changing portfolio, containing both directly and inversely correlated positions, in his head. A former intern commented, “The things Benedict does mentally other people need computers to do.”

Risk management dominates Benedict’s approach. To say he is cautious is an understatement. If his losses in any month approach 2.5 percent, Benedict will liquidate the entire portfolio and start with a clean slate the next day, trading at a reduced position size. Typically, after a 2.0 percent to 2.5 percent decline, he will cut his unit size to one-half or less the normal level. Benedict will continue to trade at a smaller size until he starts making money again. The rapidity with which Benedict cuts his exposure explains why he has never had a large monthly loss. His worst month in 13 years of trading (seven years in his fund and six years previously in a managed account and proprietary account) was a moderate 3.5 percent loss.

David Horowitz, a former trader, and the chief operating officer for Banyan, describes Benedict as follows: “Larry is essentially a risk manager. It’s not about making a lot of money. Of course, it’s important to have return, but for Larry it’s more important not to lose money. He knows that if he can manage the risk, he will make money. He understands when he is wrong, and he knows when he has to get out. Fundamental managers say, ‘I’m going to buy this stock for the next six months because I think this will happen.’ Technical managers say, ‘If the stock goes here I will buy, and if it goes here I will sell.’ Larry doesn’t fit into either group. Larry has spent so much time in front of the screens watching these markets trade versus each other that he has a sense of when to buy and sell. Larry lets the market dictate to him what he should do, which is very different from how most managers approach trading.”

After joining Spear Leeds in 1990, Benedict was net profitable for 20 consecutive years. The streak, however, ended in 2011—just barely—when his fund lost 0.6 percent. Since its inception in 2004, Benedict’s fund has realized an average annualized compounded net return of 11.5 percent (19.3 percent gross). If this return does not sound sufficiently impressive, keep in mind that it was achieved with an extremely low annualized volatility of 5.8 percent and, even more impressive, a maximum drawdown of less than 5 percent. Benedict’s return/risk numbers are exemplary. His Sharpe ratio is very high at 1.5. The Sharpe ratio, however, understates Benedict’s performance because this statistic does not distinguish between upside and downside volatility, and in Benedict’s case, most of the limited volatility is on the upside. Benedict’s Gain to Pain ratio is an extremely high 3.4. (See Appendix A for an explanation of the Gain to Pain ratio.)

Benedict won’t allow family or friends to invest in his fund, as one of his friends since childhood told me. “Larry will never take any investor money from friends or family. I tried to convince him to take money from me, but he wouldn’t do it. When I was managing a multistrategy fund of funds, he wouldn’t even let the firm invest because I was the one directing the investment. He doesn’t want to bear the responsibility. After 2008, when his parents had lost a lot of money in their conventional investments, just like most other investors, while his fund was up 14 percent, I asked him, ‘Larry, don’t you now regret that you didn’t let your parents and friends invest with you?’ He answered, ‘No, that doesn’t change anything. It would just add another layer of distraction. I would rather write my parents a check if they needed the money than ever have them in the fund.’ ”

I visited Benedict at his offices in Boca Raton, Florida. Although there is ample space in their office complex, Benedict and his entire team are crowded together in a single room. Because of the confined quarters, and to avoid continuous distractions, we conducted the interview in an overly spacious, but entirely unassuming, conference room. Assistants would periodically come in to advise Benedict of market price moves and to get his trading instructions. I thought it odd that the conference room was about five times larger than might ever be needed, whereas the trading room was cramped. John Apperson, a managing director at Centennial Partners and an investor in Banyan who had brought Benedict to my attention, explained this oddity in a phone conversation several months later. “A number of years ago when Banyan expanded their operation a bit with the growth of assets, they were all jammed together in that little room you saw. They decided to build out a new trading room in a larger space. The first day after they had relocated, Larry had a bad trading day. He said, ‘That’s it. Rip it out. We are moving back.’ What would appear to most of us as a much less comfortable work environment is not that way for Larry. Maybe he is more comfortable there because he can reach all his employees.”

Benedict is a happily transplanted New Yorker who lives in Florida with his wife, Lisa, and three sons. He loves the casual Florida lifestyle and dresses the part. Even though Benedict had institutional investors visiting his offices the day I interviewed him, he was wearing shorts and a T-shirt (maybe they were his dress shorts). Although the room was surprisingly chilly (and I’m someone who likes air conditioning set to cold temperatures), Benedict, who was more appropriately dressed for a heat wave, seemed perfectly comfortable.

Benedict was downright jovial in our conversation, but he was surprisingly candid about making me aware of the darker side of his temperament. In the course of our interview, Benedict enlisted several witnesses, both in person and by phone, to testify to his predilection to anger outbursts—a character trait I would not have guessed he had without his assistance. I later learned that his staff stocks ample inventories of phones, cell phones, and especially keyboards—items that are particularly vulnerable targets of Benedict’s periodic temper flares.

How would you describe your trading approach?

I am probably different from any of the other traders you’ll interview. If you come into my office, you’ll see that I don’t look at charts at all during the trading day. I am just tape reading.

And you don’t use fundamentals either?

I understand the fundamentals, but they don’t come into play in my short duration trading.

You certainly are different. I have interviewed fundamental traders who don’t look at charts, but you are definitely the first discretionary technical trader that I’ve interviewed who doesn’t use charts. So right away, we can say you are in a category of one.

I sort of have the chart in my head. I look at prices and markets versus other markets. Our trade durations are very short, anywhere from a few seconds to a day or two.

What markets are you trading?

My main market is S&P futures, which I trade both on its own and versus other highly liquid futures markets, such as the euro, yen, T-notes, gold, and crude oil.

How did you get started in trading?

When I was a senior at Syracuse University, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do. I was dating a girl whose father was a soybean trader on the Chicago Board of Trade. On one of my vacations, he took me to the trading floor. That was my first exposure to the futures markets.

Did you know anything about futures?

Zero. I didn’t know anybody who traded or who was even in the business.

What was your impression when you went on the floor?

It was the most awesome thing I ever saw. I thought, “This is what I got to do.” I loved that it was aggressive and competitive. When I was growing up, I played a lot of sports, and I was ultracompetitive.

Did you try to get a job on the floor after you graduated?

A friend of my aunt’s family was a market maker on the floor of the CBOE and helped me get a job as a clerk. At the time, I thought $5,000 was a lot of money. The guy I was working for had $15 million in his account, and on my first day on the job I remember walking a $1 million check over to Goldman Sachs. The clerk that I was replacing trained me for a day. He told me, “Listen, you’re going to get fired every day. Just come back the next day.” I’m 21 years old, in a new city where I don’t know anyone, and I am being told that I will be fired every day. It was a bit unsettling.

On the first day, I was thrown into the fire. I knew absolutely nothing. My boss was hand signaling me from the pit. I didn’t know the hand signals yet; I had to learn them from a sheet they handed you. We go back to the office after the first day of work, and he says, “My account is off by 20 lots. Get the hell out of my office, and don’t come back. You’re fired.”

What did you do?

I came in to the office the next morning, tail between my legs, and sat down at the desk. He didn’t say anything and acted as if everything was normal. And then two days later he says, “You don’t know what you’re doing. You’re fired.”

During those first few days, did you think that maybe you didn’t want to do this? It sounds like a miserable job.

[He laughs hard.] It was miserable.

Did things get any better?

No, it was definitely a bad period of time. He really needed an experienced clerk. After six months we reached a mutual decision that I should leave. I took an easier job as a runner on the floor.

After working for about a year as a runner, I got a trading position for a firm run by Steve Fossett, the famous world adventurer. The deal was that you would put up $10,000 of your own money, and the firm supplemented it with $15,000. You kept all the profits on your own portion of the funds and 60 percent of the profits on the firm’s capital. The firm supplied you with an exchange seat for which you paid a monthly rental fee.

What had you learned that made you think you could make money as a trader?

Not much. To be frank, I didn’t have a handle on what to do. I was just making bets. I just thought I could do it. What’s funny is that I remember calling my mom and saying, “My friend Andy is making a fortune, and I can’t seem to make a dime.” She said, “Oh, then just do what he does.”

What exchange were you trading on?

I was originally on the CBOE trading options on stocks, such as Chrysler and Revlon. Then they moved me over to the New York Stock Exchange to trade the index, the NYA, which is where I was at the time of the 1987 crash. In 1988, I went to the Amex to trade the XMI, the major market index, which is an index based on 20 blue-chip stocks.

Did you trade on the day of the crash?

Yes, I came in short . . .

Wow, that’s great.

No, I came in short straddles.1 I was short 20 calls and 20 puts.

Oh my God, that drastically changes the picture.

What was ironic about that day is that not only did the puts skyrocket as the market crashed, but the calls also went up because volatility exploded. So I was losing money on both sides of the trade. The account went from somewhere around $25,000 to a deficit in a matter of hours. I was frozen. I called Steve Fossett to ask him what I should do. He said, “Stay on the bid; you’ll get it.” The market just kept falling, and I panicked and bought back my puts. I kept the calls. It didn’t make sense to me that the calls should be way up when the Dow was down 500 points. I covered the calls a couple of days later.

Where was the account when you covered the puts?

It was probably in deficit around $10,000. This was not a big amount, but if you lose all your money, it doesn’t make a difference if it’s $20,000 or $1 million. I thought I was done. After I got out of my puts, I left the floor. I remember walking around Wall Street in a daze. There was a reporter from one of the local TV stations who asked me, “Can you give us a comment?” All I could say was, “This is unbelievable.” That quote actually made it onto TV.

Yes, I remember that day well. Even 2008 paled by comparison because in 1987 virtually the entire move happened in one day.

One of my most important experiences was being on the floor on the day of the 1987 crash. Seeing that day taught me that anything can happen.

How did it feel when you got out of the position?

It felt good [he laughs].

I assume you would have lost more if you stayed with the position?

A lot more. The put options went up so much by the end of the day that I probably would have been down several hundred thousand dollars if I stayed with the position. They crushed the market on the close, and the volatility went insane. The puts that I covered at 20 probably went as high as 200.

Since you had taken the account into a deficit, you obviously couldn’t trade. What happened next?

The firm had a standard policy of replenishing traders’ accounts with $25,000 if you blew through the first $25,000. You would become a prop trader for the firm.

It seems like an odd structure. What was the logic of the firm giving traders additional money after they lost the initial stake?

They felt that there was a good probability you would chew through the initial capital, which was partly your own money, because of the learning curve. They figured you would have a better chance once you had the experience. Also, they were earning commissions off your trades, so if you just broke even, they would do quite well. It was in their interest to try to keep you trading.

How did you do with the second $25,000?

I floundered and had gone through part of that capital as well when a friend of mine, who was a market maker, approached me with an offer to trade a $50,000 prop account for him and another guy. The deal was that they would allow me to lose $30,000 before pulling the plug on the account. I wasn’t doing well with the Fossett account, so I made the switch.

Since you hadn’t made any money, on what basis was he offering you the account?

He saw me trade in the pit, and I guess he thought I could make money. I don’t know why he thought that, but he did. I also think he wanted to give me a shot. What happened was that after I had been trading the account for about one month, I lost $16,000. I called him that night to let him know about the loss I had taken. It was the most difficult call I ever had to make because he was a friend of mine, and he had given me an opportunity. He told me to take some time off to clear my head. After I came back, though, he told me they had decided to terminate the account.

I have to ask you this. You got fired from your first job. Then you got a trading job and blew through the money. They gave you more money, and you blew through most of that. Then a friend gave you a stake, and you lost money so quickly that he pulled the plug before you reached your cutoff point. [As I am reciting this litany, Benedict’s laughter builds steadily.] Didn’t you at some point say to yourself, “Maybe I’m not cut out to be a trader”?

No. I never gave up.

I know you never gave up, but not to be cruel, on what basis did you have any confidence?

I just wanted to learn how to do it and win. I saw all these other guys making money, and I thought if they could do it, I could do it. But up to this point, I had no strategy and no discipline. I was, however, gaining experience. All the mistakes I was making along the way—and there were many—were providing experience, which was critical. The lessons I learned from those early failures helped me become successful.

What did you do next?

The pit was like a fraternity. One of the other traders in the pit who worked for Spear Leeds offered me a job as a specialist. I was the specialist for the XMI calls. I owe a lot of my success to Spear Leeds. They gave me stability. Larry Lovecchio, who I worked for at Spear Leeds, taught me discipline. I watched how he traded—the risk he took and how he protected the capital.

Were you just making the market in the XMI calls or were you also trading a proprietary account?

Both. As the specialist you provide liquidity. You also have an inherent advantage in trading because you see the order book.

When you fill an order, how do you lay off the risk?

If I was a seller of calls, I would buy futures against it. I would keep the book close to delta neutral.

So you were essentially making the bid/ask spread and laying off the risk.

Yes, but as a specialist, you also have to anticipate. If the market is strong, and you know you will have call buyers all day, you buy futures ahead of that. In other words, you anticipate your hedge needs and adjust your delta. That process was part of developing a feel for the market, which I never had in all those years of just knocking around.

How did you develop that feel?

I started paying attention to the intermarket price relationships. For example, if the S&P was moving in an inverse lockstep to the bonds, and bonds were down for the day, but the S&P was not responding on the upside, it would tell me I should sell the S&P. It’s funny, now, crude and the S&P are moving up and down together. That is something new. Before, we never even looked at crude.

[One of the firm’s employees comes into the conference room to discuss a position with Benedict. Benedict gives him some instructions and then continues our conversation.]

Sorry about that. I traded so badly today.

What did you do wrong today?

I trade a lot of mean reversion. One of the things I do is three days up, three days down. If the market is up three days in a row, I want to start getting short, and if it’s down three days in a row, I want to start getting long. The euro sold off during the past few days, and I started going long. The position will probably be okay, but it was down a number that was as much as I was willing to lose, so I covered most of it.

Do you know where you will get out before you get in?

It’s based on the P&L. If I am down more than 2 percent month-to-date on any day, I will clear out everything. I wasn’t near that point today, but the daily P&L was down more than I wanted to lose, so I liquidated.

How much was that?

$10 million.

In percentage terms?

A little less than 1 percent. I know that doesn’t sound like much compared to most hedge funds, but I am a grinder.

But what did you actually do wrong today?

The stuff that I do just didn’t work today.

But that’s not doing something wrong. There’s a big difference between losing on your trades and doing something wrong.

What I did wrong was this. I had a number in my mind for the year where I wanted to be. I wanted to get to about 14 percent gross for the year, which would get me above 10 percent net. I was close to there at the start of the month [November]. I kept pushing and pushing, and I just couldn’t make any headway.

Was the mistake then pushing harder than justified by the trading opportunities?

Yes.

You run your risk control much tighter than most hedge fund managers. Where does that extreme risk-averseness come from?

I guess it comes from losing so many times early in my career when I didn’t have any controls. I just don’t want to lose again.

How did you go from trading the XMI to trading other markets?

The volume in the XMI was drying up. So I told Spear Leeds that I wanted to trade other markets, and they let me go ahead. That was when I began doing what I am doing today.

Your trading style is very short term. Do you have any longer-term market views?

I’m as opinionated as anyone else. I have a broad global macro view, but I express it in a day or a few days in duration.

Does it affect your trades?

I don’t let it affect my trades. I have investors visit, and when they ask me my opinion on the market, I will tell them. I may tell them that I think the broad market looks negative, and then the next month the market is up 4 percent. They will call me and ask, “How could you be up last month when you were bearish and the market rallied? And the answer is that I let the market dictate to me how I should be trading, not my macro views of what I think the market will do.

You never let your macro views influence your trading?

Infrequently. In October 2008, I did something I normally don’t do—I let a market assumption that I thought was right, but ultimately proved to be wrong, influence my trading. At the time, with the U.S. in a financial meltdown, I thought that Japan would dramatically outperform the U.S. because it had already had its banking crisis. My mistake was that every hedge fund manager in the world was long Japan, Hong Kong, and China, and those markets went down more than the U.S. because they had to liquidate their positions. That trade cost me a lot.

Have the markets changed since your early days of trading?

The growing influence of high-frequency trading has changed the behavior of the market and has made it more difficult for someone like me who is a pure tape reader looking for clues in the market action. I am trying to adapt, as I always do, to changes in the market. On the other hand, the advent of electronic trading, which made high-frequency trading possible, has also been great for me.

Why is that?

Because now I don’t have to talk to anyone. As you can see being up here, the phones don’t ring. I can buy and sell anonymously. Before, when my orders were placed through the pit, the brokers would steal from me, and I still made money.

You probably have some anecdotes of times you got ripped off.

[Benedict laughs long and hard. He calls a broker on the speakerphone whom he has dealt with since the preelectronic trading days. They reminisce about some of the “rip-offs” Benedict experienced when orders were filled exclusively in the pits. The most egregious of these was Benedict getting a fill on a buy order at the low of the day, and then, later in the day, being told he no longer had a fill because the pit committee had invalidated the low of the day. For my benefit, Benedict next asked his broker friend to describe his demeanor in some of these situations.]

What was I like on the phone 10 years ago?

[Broker on speakerphone in a tone exaggerated to express obvious sarcasm] You were wonderful. You were always kind to me.

No, give me a straight answer.

[Broker] We considered making a tape called “Benny’s Greatest Fits” [Benny being Larry Benedict’s nickname].

I have someone here who is interviewing me, and I’m trying to explain the difference between executing orders now versus what it was like when orders went to the floor.

[Broker] You can’t even compare the two.

I was explaining that I made money back at that time despite the disadvantage.

[Broker] It was the greatest disadvantage.

[Benedict thanks his friend and hangs up.]

The inherent disadvantage was that my order went into the pit, and they would yell, “86 for 400.” You didn’t have to be that smart to know that you could bid 86¼ because there were 400 bid at 86. It was a huge disadvantage. Now no one knows anything because the trade is on the computer.

What is the last time you lost your temper, and who were you angry with?

About four days ago. I was angry at myself. I ripped out the phone and threw it against the wall. I am the worst sore loser you ever met. I am brutal on myself. I can make money 9 days out of 10 and still be so angry about losing on the 10th day.

What happened four days ago?

I was getting hurt on a trade and released some aggression.

How often do you lose your temper?

Much less than I used to because the playing field has become level. Originally, my anger stemmed from my not being able to handle being ripped off and lied to. Before electronic trading, it used to be almost every day and sometimes even multiple times a day. When I was working for Spear Leeds, people could hear me on the other floor. That’s how loud I was.

Who were you yelling at?

The brokers.

[An assistant brings in lunch, and Benedict addresses the question to him.] Do I have a bad temper?

[Assistant speaking] The evidence is over there. [He points to a broken phone on the floor.] We have stacks of broken phones.

Do you buy them in gross?

[Benedict speaking] At Spear Leeds, they actually charged my account for broken phones. They subtracted it from my P&L [he laughs]. I’ve gotten a lot better over the years, but I used to be very bad. [Benedict calls another friend on the speakerphone.] Do I have a bad temper?

[There is a 20-second laugh before the voice on the speakerphone replies.] You are a great guy, but you definitely have a dark side.

[Benedict] How dark?

[Friend] We don’t want to go there. Put it this way, I wouldn’t want to be on the other side of your wrath. Many phones have not survived you.

I understand that you worked for Marty Schwartz.2 How did that come about?

I was at Spear Leeds at the time. I was trading the S&P 500 and getting a reputation of doing fairly well. Marty Schwartz was in the process of moving from New York to Florida and solicited me to come work for him. I knew of Marty from your book Market Wizards and thought it would be a privilege to work for him. I went to my boss, Peter Kellogg, and told him that I had an offer to work for Marty Schwartz in Florida. Peter knew Marty and told me, “You can try it out, but no one can last very long with Marty. I’m going to do you a favor. I am going to keep you on the payroll.”

Schwartz had a reputation for holding on to employees only briefly, either because he fired them or they quit. Benedict, who worked for Schwartz for several months, may have been one of his longest-term hires. Ironically, I visited Schwartz—the first time I had seen him since our original interview—on the same trip on which I interviewed Benedict. When I mentioned Benedict, he literally shuddered. His comments regarding Benedict, which I will not repeat here, were uniformly negative. Benedict’s portrayal of Schwartz was equally unflattering, although he did credit Schwartz with paying for his relocation and acknowledged his phenomenal skill as a trader.

What did you learn from Schwartz?

Don’t average losing trades. Be smaller than you need to be. Take profits.

What happened after your brief stint of working for Schwartz?

I went back to Spear Leeds. Peter Kellogg, who had warned me that I wouldn’t last with Schwartz, liked me and gave me the opportunity to set up a Spear Leeds office in South Florida with another partner. We set up an operation with multiple managers trading different market groups. I directly traded a global macro portfolio and also oversaw the other traders.

Why did you leave Spear Leeds?

In 2000, Spear Leeds was bought out by Goldman Sachs. Goldman didn’t want an operation in Florida and asked me to come back to New York. I loved it down here and had no desire to go back to a suit-and-tie world. Steven Schonfeld of Schonfeld Securities offered me an opportunity to run a managed account for him. That is when I set up Banyan.

What was your experience during 9/11?

9/11 was a major learning experience for me. That morning I got a call from the broker covering me at Goldman Sachs. He said, “There is a plane sticking out of the World Trade Center.” I didn’t know what was going on, but I figured it can’t be good. My immediate response was to start selling futures.

Was the market selling off at the time?

Not at that point. I don’t know if you remember, but the market was very strong going into 9/11. The crash hadn’t hit the news yet. Then when the initial story came across the tape, it said that a small plane had hit the World Trade Center. The market actually went up. At the time, I had no idea what was really going on, but I thought it was ridiculous that the market was rallying, so I sold more.

The market went up after the news first came out?

Yes, go look at the chart. All of a sudden, the second plane hit the World Trade Center. The stock market hadn’t opened yet, but the futures were trading. The market started dropping hard. I had the broker on the phone, and I told him, “I don’t know what’s going on, but I’m leaving and going to pick up my kids at school. Just sell me out of everything.”

Why were you leaving?

I just wanted to get my kids. They were showing the planes hitting in New York and Washington.

But you were in Florida. What were they going to do—take out Palm Beach?

I agree. But what was going on was crazy, and I just wanted to be with my family.

Why did you liquidate your position before you left?

I didn’t want to capitalize on people’s misfortune. I felt weird having that short position. I still made a large profit on the day trade, but I left most of the money on the table relative to where the market traded when it reopened the following week. When the market reopened, I decided to be Mr. Patriotic. At the same time everyone else was selling, I was buying stocks and futures. Very quickly, I lost all the profit I had made on the 9/11 trades and then some.

You said that 9/11 was a major learning experience. In what way?

I learned that you can’t be emotional in this business. It’s a business and nothing else. Going long when the market reopened was a purely emotional trade.

Do you think that your going long when the market reopened was influenced by guilt at having made money on 9/11 by being short?

Maybe. I never thought about it that way. I don’t want to make excuses.

Actually, you were cheering for one side, which is a lethal mistake for a trader. As you know, you have to be neutral in this game. Your story reminds me of Ed Seykota’s provocative observation in the first Market Wizards book: “Everybody gets what they want out of the market.” Putting it into context of your experience on 9/11, you wanted to not feel guilty about having made money being short on 9/11, and by losing it all by being long when the market reopened, that’s exactly what you got.

You have seen a lot of traders both on the floor and off the floor. What are some common mistakes traders make?

One big mistake is averaging losing trades. Trading is very hard, but it is also easy if you maintain discipline. People blow up because they lose their discipline.

I originally met with Benedict in late 2010. I called him in July 2011 for a midyear update.

I’ve had a very bad year. We’re down almost 3 percent, and I’m trading smaller.

Well, that’s consistent with your risk discipline. I guess it’s probably a good thing that you are trading smaller or else you would have been down more.

Absolutely, but one of the hard things about managing client money is that although I am very patient, the clients aren’t very patient. One of my problems is that I want to make everyone happy.

I’ll give you some advice: You always have to manage money for yourself, not your clients. Once you start adjusting your trading to fit what your investors want, you are in trouble. I’ve talked to a lot of managers who made that mistake.

After rereading the chapter, I felt that a key question had still not been satisfactorily answered. I called Benedict again in October 2011 with some follow-up questions.

One key question I still have is: What changed when you went from being a losing trader to a consistently winning one? Where was your edge coming from?

I learned to pay attention to how markets moved relative to each other. I became a correlation trader—the same thing I still do today.

Can you provide some examples to illustrate how you trade markets against each other?

My problem is that I could never teach my kids or friends what I do because it is so innate. I am constantly trading. It’s not like there is one type of trade or even a few specific trades. I trade off of correlations, but I don’t constantly trade the same way. I am sensitive to when the correlations are working and when they are not working. So a trade might work in one time frame, but not in another, and I am constantly adapting.

As soon as I put on a position, I immediately start looking for a trade that would be the best offsetting hedge. Say I go long the S&P, I would be looking at my 10 screens for the best hedge. It might be selling another index, or selling a deep-in-the-money call, or selling an out-of-the-money call, or buying bonds (when it is inversely correlated), or taking an inversely correlated position in the euro. And sometimes, I will not put on any offsetting trade, but just use a stop on the position.

But how do you decide which is the best hedge?

By watching the market movements. For example, right now the S&P is trading at 1227, and the bonds are coming off a bit, which tells me that the S&P should probably hold here and start to rally. If I buy it, and it doesn’t rally, I would look to buy bonds against it.

Why would that be better than just getting out of the S&P?

This is where the correlation comes into play. The last time the S&P was trading at 1,227, the bonds were 25 bid, and now they are 20 bid. Usually, when the bonds go down, the S&P goes up. So the S&P should hold here, and if it doesn’t, then the bonds should rally. I think I could buy the S&P here and buy the bonds and make money.

Do you have a current directional bias in the S&P?

I’m very bearish.

Why?

Because I don’t think the European situation is going to end well [reference to the debt crisis of the weaker European countries], and they are bidding up the market expecting some grand solution that is probably not going to happen. But again, that is not what I do. I don’t make major directional bets. I am a very opinionated guy, but for the first five years of the business, my opinion did nothing but lose me money. So I have to leave my opinions at the door. I think the market is going to eventually crash, but I have to stay in business, and I can’t make that bet.

Did you have a position coming into the day?

I was modestly net long.

Why net long if you’re bearish?

I came in long because today was option expiration day, and 85 percent of the time, they mark up the market on the morning of option expiration day. It has been going on for 25 years.

Can we go back to the S&P and bond example?

Okay, right now, the bonds are still at 20 bid and the S&P is bid $.75 higher. That move is equal to about 3/32 in the bonds, given that my bond position is about one-third the size of my S&P position. I could take profits on the S&P, put a stop in three ticks lower on the bonds, and if I’m not stopped out, take profits three ticks higher. The worst I would do is approximately break even, and if the bonds move up three ticks, I’ll make money on both sides. It is that simple. I do lots of these trades every day. Sometimes my positions are big; sometimes they are small. Whether they are big or small depends primarily on how I am doing for the month and what our P&L is for the year to date.

Since you don’t trade on your longer-term directional views, how do you decide whether you want to be long or short the S&P?

I try to look at anything the market thinks is important at the moment. Right now, I’m looking at financial stocks in the U.S. and Europe as well as European markets in general because those are the key factors that are driving the current market. I am sure a year from now, I will be looking at completely different things. A year ago, everything was China; now China is irrelevant. So that clue doesn’t work anymore.

Why do you think you have been successful whereas so many other traders fail?

Since I started in the business, I have seen a number of traders who ended up committing suicide or being homeless. The one trait they all shared was that they had a gambler’s mentality. When they were losing, they were always looking for that one trade that would make it all back. I learned early on that you can’t do that. This is a business where you have to work. That is what I do. Every day I make hundreds of transactions. I grind out the returns. If you look at my daily returns, you will see there are very few big up days.

The essence of Benedict’s approach is that he looks at markets in context of the price action in other markets, rather than in isolation. Markets are correlated, but these correlations come and go and can change radically over time. There are times when the S&P and T-bonds will move in the same direction, and times when they will move in opposite directions. There are times when the S&P 500 will follow crude oil prices, and times when the stock market ignores crude oil prices. Benedict is intently watching these intermarket relationships, not merely day by day, but minute by minute. At any given time, the price action in a market may be highly influenced (directly or inversely) by the price action of another market or several other markets.

Knowing the prevailing correlations is only the start. There is no rulebook as to what trades to do when a correlated market has a price move. Sometimes, the trade will be to anticipate a lagged response; sometimes the failure for a market to respond as expected may signal inherent market strength or weakness. Frequently, the implied trade may be to trade one correlated market versus another. For example, if two markets are positively correlated, Benedict may short the market that seems overextended, using a long in the correlated market as a hedge. The timing of such paired long and short positions will not necessarily be simultaneous, either on entry or exit, and will depend on the prevailing price levels of each market relative to its expected range. In short, to say that Benedict uses market correlations as a key input is only the beginning. The selection and implementation of actual trades will be highly variable, depending on multiple considerations and past experience. The process is entirely discretionary, rather than formulaic.

The relevant lesson for traders is that the price action of other markets can contain useful information—Benedict’s track record stands as a testament to this proposition. How this information can be used, however, must be discovered and developed by each individual trader based on personal observation and trading style. The message for traders is to be cognizant of how markets move relative to each other and to determine whether this source of observation can lead to useful trading ideas.

Benedict serves as a model for extreme risk management. There are two key aspects of Benedict’s risk management approach. First, he limits portfolio risk to a small fixed amount (2.0 to 2.5 percent) before he responds with actions to mitigate further losses. Second, when this small drawdown threshold is approached, he reduces his position size and continues to trade smaller until he begins to be profitable again. A 2.5 percent portfolio risk level may be overly restrictive for many traders, but the key concept of setting a predefined loss point at which risk exposure is significantly reduced has widespread applicability. Also, reducing exposure when trading is not going well—an inherent component in Benedict’s risk management approach—is generally a wise action for discretionary traders. (For systematic traders, however, reducing exposure after losses may lead to poor timing of position sizing.) The type of rigorous risk control practiced by Benedict may be as difficult for most traders to follow as the Ornish diet is for those trying to lose weight, but it can certainly be highly effective in avoiding significant losses.

Mark Rossano, who was given a small portfolio to manage while he was an intern at Banyan Capital, recalls Benedict’s obsession with risk management, saying, “The biggest principle Larry pushes is that you are not a trader; you are a risk manager.” He recounts Benedict’s advice on risk control: “Never stay in a losing trade because you think it will come back. Minimize the loss. Accept the loss and walk away from it. The worst thing any trader can do is freeze. You need to know how you will respond in any situation. How are you going to not lose money while making money? How are you going to get out of your losers? How are you going to keep your winners from turning into losers?”

Trades should be motivated by opportunity. Traders should caution against trading out of a desire to make money. In late 2010, Benedict pushed to reach his target for a minimum annual return. By doing marginal trades he would not otherwise have taken, he only succeeded in falling further short of his target.

1A short straddle is a combined short call and short put position. A short straddle will make money (all or part of the premium received for selling the options) if the market trades within a moderate price range. It is, effectively, a bet that the market will not be volatile. If the market, however, witnesses a sharp swing in either direction, the short straddle position can be subject to large losses. The maximum profit on a short straddle position is limited to the premium received. The maximum loss, however, is not merely unlimited, but accelerates exponentially if there is a large price move in either direction.

## Chapter 4
`Scott Ramsey`
### Low-Risk Futures Trader
I don’t think I have ever been to a more unusual location for a hedge fund office—although the manager I had visited years ago located above a urology office in Brooklyn, New York, is probably a close second. To begin, Ramsey manages his fund from that hotbed of hedge fund activity—St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. If I had been driven to Ramsey’s office by a taxi, I would have sworn the driver had made a mistake or that I had incorrectly copied the address. But I had been picked up at my hotel by one of Ramsey’s employees, so clearly I was in the right place. I stepped out of the car and gazed around the small shopping center. No building even remotely suggested the presence of office space. Ramsey’s assistant led me into Gallows Bay Hardware and up the stairs. This was the location of Ramsey’s trading firm, Denali Asset Management—an incongruous name for a firm located on a Caribbean island.

The location of his office is not the only unorthodox thing about Scott Ramsey. He dropped out of college with a near-perfect GPA and only nine credits short of a degree to pursue a career in futures trading. Although it is a decision that seems bafflingly irrational to me, give credit to Ramsey for knowing exactly what he wanted to do, and as he says, “It turned out okay.”

Ramsey trades the highly liquid futures and foreign exchange (FX) markets. Although the majority of Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs)1 use a systematic approach, Ramsey is strictly a discretionary trader. He also differs from most CTAs by incorporating fundamentals into his decision-making process. Ramsey begins by establishing a broad fundamental macro view that determines his directional bias in each market. Once this bias is established, he will seek to go short the weakest market in a sector if he is bearish or long the strongest market if he is bullish, using technical analysis to time trade entry and position adjustments. Ramsey will score his best returns when he gets the fundamentals right, but even when he is wrong, his rigorous risk control keeps losses relatively small.

Ramsey’s 11-year track record is better than that of many of the largest and best-known futures managers. He has never had a down year, and has been able to combine a solid 17.2 percent average annual compounded net return (25.7 percent gross) with relatively low volatility and moderate drawdowns. Return alone is a highly inadequate metric for a futures manager because it is so dependent on the exposure level chosen by the manager. Futures managers always use only a fraction of assets under management to meet margin requirements. Therefore, any futures manager can double returns by simply doubling exposure without any need for borrowing. High return could just as easily represent excessive risk-taking rather than manager skill. Consequently, in evaluating futures managers, the only meaningful metric is return/risk.2 Ramsey achieved his returns with well below average risk statistics. The annualized standard deviation has been 11.7 percent, less than two-thirds of the net return level. The maximum drawdown has been less than 11 percent. Ramsey’s Gain to Pain ratio is a very high 2.2. (See Appendix A for a detailed explanation of the Gain to Pain ratio.)

Ramsey is 53, but looks a decade younger. Clearly, if trading provides any stress, it certainly doesn’t show. Ramsey was quite relaxed during our interview, as perhaps fitting for a manager domiciled on St. Croix. After the interview, we picked up my wife, Jo Ann, at the hotel, and Ramsey took us out to dinner at an incredibly good local restaurant (Bacchus—check it out if you are ever in Christiansted), which served the best sashimi dish I’ve ever had (presented on a block of salt) and had an extraordinary collection of Belgian beers.

When did you first become aware of markets?

I was a mechanical engineering student at the University of Missouri. My father had always pushed me to take some business classes. So, in my junior year, as an elective, I took an economics course. It changed my life. In engineering, there is always a right answer. All of a sudden, I am faced with economics where there are all these shades of gray. I was fascinated by it. Our economics professor suggested that we subscribe to the Wall Street Journal, which I did. Every day I would see these ads for precious metals and energy. This was in the late 1970s, when inflation was in double digits. At the time, my money was in a savings account earning the minimum interest rate, which was much less than the rate of inflation. I thought I should check into buying metals. So I responded to one of the ads in the Wall Street Journal and bought gold, silver, and copper.

Were these futures you bought?

No, it was over-the-counter metals. I opened an account with First Commodity Corp of Boston (FCCB), which charged an exorbitant commission rate. I’m not proud of that decision, but I guess it shows I was a sucker for their marketing. I believe the CFTC shut them down for improper disclosures.

Why didn’t you buy futures instead?

I was a novice. I didn’t know about futures. This was my entrée into buying metals.

How did you know what the prices were since you weren’t going through an organized market?

The prices were pegged off the futures market.

So you bought and sold at a futures linked price, but they charged you an exorbitant commission. I don’t get it.

The way it worked was that FCCB charged you a flat fee of $1,200 per market, and then you could buy and sell as much as you wanted in that market for six months. But they would try to get you to trade in another market, so they could charge you another $1,200. If you were trading silver, they would try to talk you into doing a trade in copper.

But since the prices were pegged to futures, didn’t you think of just going directly to futures?

That is what I eventually ended up doing. By the time I was a senior, I had a quote screen in my apartment. But, at this point, I had already paid the flat fee for trading for six months. I was trading the markets pretty actively. At one point, I was up over $10,000, which was an incredible amount to me. At the time, you could have bought two cars for that amount of money. I couldn’t believe how easy it was to make money. You just bought something, and it went up. This was in 1979 when commodities were going ballistic.

On what basis were you making your trading decisions?

I really had no idea what I was doing. I would buy something, and when it went up, I would sell it. I was making money because I was buying in a rising market. I can actually say that I bought silver at $50, which is right near the all-time high. Then Volcker raised interest rates sharply to fight inflation and, on top of that, the exchange raised silver margins. Shortly afterwards, silver prices collapsed. The market went into a string of limit down days.3 I couldn’t do anything. I felt helpless, stupid, and powerless. Silver fell all the way down to $26 before it started trading. It was a gut-wrenching experience.

Did you get out as soon as it started trading?

The first day it traded, I got out. I lost all the money I had made plus some of the money I started with.

Did you stop trading after the big silver loss?

I took some time to reassess the situation. I read a lot of books on speculation. I had enough money left over to start trading futures. I hit it off well with a broker and opened an account with him. Much to my surprise as soon as I opened the account, I was assigned to another broker that actually traded the account. The broker I liked was just a marketing guy. Anyway, the next thing I knew I was long sugar, corn spreads, and other trades. He was a churn ’em and burn ’em broker. That account didn’t last long.

Then I opened an account at the local Heinhold commodity branch in Columbia, Missouri. I think I only had a few thousand left. This time around, I was doing all the trading myself. A couple of friends gave me some money, and I leased a quote terminal for my apartment. I spent many days watching every tick in certain markets and doing point and figure charts, in addition to my daily charts, instead of attending class. The results weren’t so good. I made every rookie mistake in the books. Rather than taking the easy route and trading with the trend, I was trying to pick tops and bottoms, and I sat with losers and took small profits.

Losing money is what got me hooked. I had heard that allegedly 90 percent of the traders in the futures markets lost money, but I was determined to be in the 10 percent. I was an excellent student, easily in the top 10 percent, and I often set the curve on exams. Whenever I took a test, my attitude was that someone had to make the highest grade on the curve, and that it might as well be me. And it often was. So being in the 90 percent that lost money in trading was not acceptable. I didn’t graduate college because I became so engrossed in futures trading that I had no interest in engineering anymore.

At what point did you drop out?

In my senior year. I had nine credits left to finish.

I find that hard to understand. It seems like it would have been such a trivial matter to finish college.

I am not saying I did the right thing, although in retrospect, it turned out okay.

Do you ever regret coming so close to graduating college and not finishing?

I never look back, although sometimes it can be embarrassing. Whenever prospective investors conduct their due diligence and ask where I graduated, I have to explain that I went to college for four years and had a high 3.9 GPA, but didn’t graduate.

What was your plan?

My plan was to go to Chicago, start in the pits, and learn how this business worked from the bottom up. I initially got a job as a phone clerk at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. After a few months, it became apparent that there was no future on the floor unless you were in the pits. I got a job as a commodity broker.

Was sales something that you wanted to do?

No, it certainly wasn’t my passion. I hated cold calling. What I wanted to do was trade. The broker job was a means to an end. It kept me involved in the markets. I remember my first month’s check was $43. To this day, I wish I had framed that check, but at the time, I really needed the $43.

Were you giving your clients recommendations?

Yes. It was all based on technicals. At the time, I knew nothing about fundamentals.

What kind of technical analysis?

It was just the basic stuff: chart patterns and moving averages. The first book I had read on trading futures was John Murphy’s book on technical analysis.4

How did your clients do?

They didn’t make much money, but they didn’t lose, either. I was able to keep them alive.

Well, that’s actually better than most brokers, especially at the high commission levels of those days. How did you get them out of trades when you were wrong?

I used stops.

Did you always have stops in place?

I always had stops.

How did you learn to do that?

One of the first books I read emphasized the importance of cutting your losses and letting your profits run.

Did any of your prior experience reinforce this basic concept?

During my senior year when I was trading futures from my apartment, I went long T-bills. The market was under steady pressure because Volcker was raising interest rates. At the time, I wasn’t using stops. Every day, the position would go against me, but it would be by only about three ticks. I thought it was no big deal; three ticks is only $75 a contract. The next day the market would be down another two or three ticks. It was a small bit of pain, but not enough to get me out. After a few weeks, what should have been a 10-tick loss ended up being a 50-tick loss, and suddenly it was real money. I realized there was no reason for letting what should have been a small loss turn into a big loss.

I learned to trade first with my own money, which didn’t work out that well, and then by advising clients as a commodity broker and doing okay. Then in 1982, I leased a seat on the IMM and went down to trade from the floor.

You gave up sales?

No. I teamed up with the broker in the office who had helped me get the job as a broker with the firm. We pooled our clients. I wanted to trade from the floor, and he stayed in the office.

How was your being on the floor going to be beneficial?

I thought that having information about who was doing what would be very helpful.

But in the office, you had the screens, which you didn’t have on the floor. Wouldn’t giving up the screens have been a disadvantage?

Good question. It turned out that it was. It was like putting blinders on. I learned to trade on a Quotron where I could see prices changing in all the markets. When I was in the pit, all I could see was what was going on in that one market. I couldn’t feel what the other external influences were on that market. I had become used to seeing all the markets trade and observing the relationships between their price movements. In fact, the relationship between price movements in different markets is a core part of my current trading strategy. I also very quickly learned that standing on my feet all day screaming wasn’t the way I wanted to make a living.

Did having the who-is-doing-what information provide any compensating benefits?

When a guy comes in and sells a 100-lot, you don’t know what it means.

But you thought that it might be helpful before you went down to the floor?

I thought that the information you would get in the pit would be the Holy Grail. I just didn’t think it through. The reality is that you get almost no useful information.

So being on the floor turned out to be a disadvantage rather than an advantage.

It was a big disadvantage.

How long was it before you realized you made a mistake?

I stayed on the floor for six months. I wanted to give it the old college try.

You felt more comfortable upstairs?

I felt more comfortable being able to see more markets.

By more markets, do you mean charts or just the prices?

At that time, the screens just gave you quotes, not charts. I received a printed chart book each week, and updated the charts every day. I think that was a great process. It made me pay attention to every market, every day. I did that for over 10 years. Even when we got CQG screens, which had graphics, I still continued to update my printed charts manually for a long time. It was a daily routine of looking at each chart and thinking about what the patterns were telling you. I would even turn the charts upside down to see whether the pattern looked different to me. Over time, it helped me develop a sense of pattern recognition.

Were you trading your own account when you were a broker?

I had been trading my own account all along.

How did you do?

I did fine. I made money virtually every year, but I didn’t make a lot of money. One thing I did wrong was that I thought only technical factors were important and that fundamentals didn’t matter. The other thing I did wrong was that every time I made money, I would pull it out. So instead of increasing my size over time, I stayed a one- and two-lot trader. I never really tried pushing myself. The evolution of a trader is when you start letting your money work for you and increasing your size.

What did you learn as a broker that allowed you to go from a string of early losses to making money almost every year?

Being a broker provided an excellent vantage point. By observing retail clients, I learned a lot about what not to do, like taking small profits and letting losses run—a lesson that I had also learned from my trading days in college. I learned about the psychology of the markets and how certain traders were surprisingly accurate at picking tops and bottoms—the wrong way—based on emotional decisions and market activity rather than technical or fundamental analysis. I learned the value of the classic “buy the rumor, sell the facts” kind of trading because it put you on the opposite side of retail buying. I also noted how the most obvious technical patterns were often the ones that didn’t work. I still look for those trades today; the more obvious they are from a chart standpoint, and the more the opposite position makes sense from a fundamental standpoint, the more interested I am if the pattern fails. So, while I try to keep emotions out of my trading, which is the real challenge, I try to imagine how the guy who took the textbook trade and is losing money feels. Where will he finally capitulate? Is this the start of a big move the other way?

When did you go from being a broker to managing money?

The first step came in 1993 when one of my clients, who was a professional trader, asked me to manage $100,000 for him. I knew what it was like to trade my own money, but I didn’t know what it was like to have power of attorney over someone else’s money. I told him, “We’re friends, and if I lose your money, I don’t want it to affect our relationship.” He said, “Scott, I give money to other people to manage; it’s what I do. I think you have good ideas in the market. I want you to trade this account for me.” I had decided that I would manage his money and my money for one year, and at the end of the year, if it worked out, I would register as a CTA and try to get other accounts.

And did you?

Yes, I started the CTA one year later.

How did you do?

I did okay, but not great. What was killing me in the process was that the brokerage firms who directed business to CTAs would set the commission rates. In my own account, I was trading at a $12 commission rate, which by today’s standards is insanely expensive, but back then was a good rate. My customers were trading at a $50 commission rate, or even higher. So I had to trade my CTA accounts different from my own account because if I traded them at the same level, it would be churning. I might be up in my own account, while at the same time, the CTA accounts could be down. That disparity really bothered me and ultimately drove me to the decision that I had to manage money in a fund.

So your performance as a CTA prior to starting the fund was dragged down by high commissions. If you had been paying the lower commissions charged in the fund you subsequently started, would your performance in your early years as a CTA have been more in line with the fund performance levels?

No, because the performance difference was not only due to the disparity in commission rates. In order to avoid an excessive commission burden on the client managed accounts, I took only about one-quarter of the trades that I did in my own account. Ultimately, I decided to switch to a fund structure, not only to control costs, but also to assure that my investors’ accounts were traded the exact same way as my own account. In 2000, I started the fund.

Did your methodology evolve over time?

It did. In my early years in the business, I was able to trade the markets technically and make money, while keeping my drawdowns very manageable. But I wasn’t making the big money. I thought about what was holding me back. The lightbulb that clicked on for me was the realization that I had to also embrace fundamentals. That insight brought me back to my original interest in economics.

When did this transition occur?

In the 1990s, after I became a CTA. I remember one of my biggest trades. At the time, there was a general consensus that government borrowing was going to crowd out private borrowing, which it was expected would be very bearish for the bond market. I was reading all these bearish articles on the bond market, but I was looking at the market, and it wasn’t going down. I thought, Wait a minute. If everyone thinks this way, and it seems so logical, then if the market goes the other way, everyone is going to be wrong, and they will have to cover their shorts. That’s your trade. From that point on, it became a matter of not only looking at prices on a chart, but also thinking about why prices were where they were, how people were positioned, and the psychology of the market. You have to try to understand what people are thinking. I began to look at the market from the perspective of other traders. What would I be feeling if I were short bonds, thinking I had this great trade, and seeing the market go against me? That line of thinking led me to take the opposite position, long bonds, which turned out to be a huge winning trade.

Ironically, the way you incorporated fundamentals in that example was in a totally contrarian manner. You weren’t using fundamentals to forecast a market direction. Instead, you were looking at the fundamentals that everyone else perceived and observing that the market was going the other way. Is that the standard way you use fundamentals?

The reality is that I’m not being paid to be right; I am being paid to make money. You have to have a degree of flexibility. Whenever I talk to investors, I make it clear to them that whatever I say today about the markets may or may not reflect the positions I have tomorrow or the next day. I recently reviewed a presentation I gave about six months ago, and I realized that everything I had predicted didn’t happen—and yet, I made money in almost every month since then.

Can you give me some specific examples of how incorporating fundamentals improved your trading?

The major trade was long bonds, which coincided with the start of the fund in 2000. At the time, we had seen a long period of stock speculation. I thought that economic conditions couldn’t get any better.5 Anyone who had a pulse had a job, equity markets were at their highs, and yet we were not generating any inflation. If we were not generating inflation under those conditions, then what would happen if we started to slow at the margins? I was so focused on the long fixed-income trade that for the first three or four years of the fund, probably two-thirds of the trades were in fixed-income.

Was it the topping of the equity market in early 2000 that got you long in fixed-income?

The break in equities was definitely the catalyst for the fixed-income trade, but the trade was going to happen anyway. I use the fundamentals to have a directional bias, and I use the technicals to confirm that bias. Once I had the catalyst, I could say that yields should never again see their previous high. I could then decide what I was willing to risk, and let the market work. I was long for years, but I traded around the position. Nothing goes in a straight line. I added on weakness and lightened up on strength.

What is a recent example of fundamentals influencing a trade?

Just last week, we had the European Central Bank bailing out Ireland, and boom, the next day, the DAX [German stock index] is at a new high, the TSE [Canadian stock index] is at a new high, and the S&P and Nasdaq are at new highs.

And what does that tell you?

It tells me that it is risk on for now. Otherwise, all these markets wouldn’t be making new highs a few days after a crisis. They might rebound, but they wouldn’t go to new highs. Think of taking a volleyball and pushing it underwater—that is your crisis event. Then you let go—the event dissipates—and the ball goes popping out of the water. That is exactly what we just experienced in the markets. Today, we had a terrible unemployment report, and yet the equity markets closed higher. The equity market’s repeated resilience in the face of negative news items tells me that it wants to go higher. Chaos creates opportunity. We learn so much about the markets when we have crisis events.

We learn from how the markets respond?

Yes. There are simple things you can do. You can calculate in percentage terms how much each market responds to a crisis event. You can then rank the markets from strongest to weakest.

Is that what you do?

Absolutely. Just a simple exercise of measuring which markets were the strongest during a crisis can tell you which markets are likely to be the leaders when the pressure is off—the markets that will be the ball popping out of the water. For example, crude made a low early in the month, and on the crisis in Ireland, it didn’t even retest that low. Then, as soon as the pressure was off, crude was $5 higher. Conversely, the markets that were weakest should be the markets that rally the least and the first ones to roll over on a general continued decline.

Is that how you pick your longs and shorts?

I always want to buy the strongest and sell the weakest. Always.

If you believe that all the markets in a sector are going higher, will you only be long the market you expect to be the strongest in that sector?

Yes, I want to be long only the market that is acting the best. The market that gets dragged up by a related market may even be a good short. Sometimes I will place a sell stop in a market that gets dragged up so that if it rolls over and starts going down, it will trigger a short position. Frequently, that market will continue to go down and go back to where it should be, while the leading market hardly corrects.

How long have the markets been in this highly correlated state?

We have been in an extremely correlated state since the 2008 financial crisis. I believe that the dog is stocks and the tail is everything else.

In general, or just recently?

Stocks rule, especially in the last few years. You better know which direction equities are going and watch how that influences other markets. Let’s say in one week, equities go up and commodities go up. That makes sense and is what you would expect. But then assume that in the following week, equities continue to rise, but commodities stall. Then, all else being equal, you better be very suspect of your long commodity positions.

As an engineering student, you would seem a natural for developing a systemized approach; yet, you developed into a strictly discretionary trader. Why do you think that is?

It just fit my personality. I enjoyed the observation part of it. I am the guy who sits in front of the screen every trading day of the year and watches all the markets change. That is just what works for me. You’re seeing things, and the wheels of your subconscious are spinning. Whether you recognize it right away or not, your mind is working out these patterns for you. Trading gets so ingrained in your psyche that it becomes second nature like driving a car. Sometimes you look at a chart and just know what to do without thinking about it.

How much do you risk on a single trade?

Typically, about 10 basis points of assets under management, but I may get out even more quickly. Some people can put on a trade, risk some specified percentage loss, and then give it months to work. I can’t do that. If I put on a trade today, and it’s not working by the end of the day, I’m out. I don’t want to take any more risk. I might get back into it tomorrow at a worse price, but that is a premium I’m willing to pay to see the market acting the way I think it should be.

Do you literally mean to imply that if you are behind on a trade the first day, you get out?

Yes, 90 percent of the time. That’s my personality. I am a chicken when it comes to taking risks.

If you get out if you are behind on the first day, presumably, you would also get out if you were behind on the trade on any subsequent day. Using such a tight exit condition, it sounds like you would be stopped out of a large percentage of your trades.

I might lose 10 times on an idea, until the 11th time when it works. If I then get the move I thought I was going to get, it will then more than make up for all the little losses. To me, the most important thing is to control the downside. Rigorous risk control is not only important in keeping losses small, but it also impacts profit potential. You have to put yourself in the position to be able to take advantage of opportunities. The only way you can do that is to have a clear mind. If you have trades that are not working, and your mental energy is going toward damage control, you can’t think clearly about opportunities in the market.

What was your worst month?

I lost 10 percent in October 2003.

How is that possible given that you are only risking 10 basis points on each trade?

For me to be down 10 percent from a standing start would be a death by 1,000 cuts. But the drawdown on a trade can be much larger than the original risk if there is a large open profit. The 10 percent loss month followed a 10 percent gain in the previous month. I was long fixed income big-time, and the unemployment report was extremely positive. It led to a giant reversal. But I had made 200 percent over the course of the prior few years trading this one theme. That reversal turned out to be the end of the theme. If I look back, would I be willing to do the same thing again? Sure I would; I would be happy to have a huge run and give back 10 percent. I had a lot of risk on because I was being paid to take risk. I can get hit when I have been getting paid, but it is hard for me to get hit from a standing start. That is the key.

If you don’t have any positions with large open profits, what would be a really bad month for you?

A 2 percent or 3 percent loss.

Besides looking at charts and chart patterns, do you use any technical indicators?

I use the Relative Strength Index (RSI), but not as an overbought/oversold indicator; instead, I look for divergences between the RSI and price. I look at the 200-day moving average and Fibonacci retracements. If the market sells off to the 200-day moving average and I’m short, I may be inclined to take the money off the table and watch how the market reacts. I particularly like to get combined signals, such as the price approaching the 200-day moving average and a 50 percent retracement. I’ll pay a lot of attention to that type of indicator combination.

What personal characteristics do you think were instrumental to your being successful as a trader?

Discipline.

Have you had any lapses in discipline?

In the early days, sure, but I haven’t taken a real hit for a very long time. I am very disciplined with my stops. If there is one principle that you cannot violate, it is: Know what you can lose.

Are there mistakes you have made that were learning experiences in terms of avoiding similar losses in the future?

I got involved in trading over-the-counter fixed-income. Call it style drift; call it whatever. When 2008 hit, the dealers wouldn’t make a market on these things. I would have been up 26 percent for the year instead of 19 percent if it weren’t for these trades. I will never again trade a market where liquidity is at the whim of a dealer.

Why with so many interest rate futures markets would you have a need to go to the over-the-counter market?

Good question, thank you. I thought the trade made sense.

But couldn’t you express the same trade in futures?

It was a convergence trade involving Muni bonds, so I couldn’t actually replicate it in futures. What I found was that there are such great benefits to trading in exchange-traded markets or the interbank market that giving up those benefits is just not worth it. Lower liquidity doesn’t work with my style. I need to be able to stop myself out in 10 basis points if I want to.

Did you ever think you were wrong on a trade, but still had trouble liquidating it?

My failsafe is that I always have a stop in the market. Sometimes, though, my intuition tells me that I should get out right away, but I don’t do anything, hoping my stop won’t be hit. Then sure enough, I end up getting stopped out. My misplaced hope and my desire to still be right sometimes cause my losses to be greater than they need to be. Hope is the worst four-letter word for a trader.

Do you think intuition is important to trading?

It is very important. I think intuition is a subconscious skill you develop over time.

How do you handle a losing streak?

I believe that you should always be swinging the bat. The question is when do you choke up on the bat. When I am in a drawdown, I will choke up on the bat—I reduce my position size. When I am more attuned to the market and playing with market money, I will increase my position size. But I never stop trading. In 30 years of trading, I bet you could count on one hand the times I have been completely flat.

How do you manage that and still take vacations?

I always time my travel for when the markets are closed. I still follow the markets when I am on vacation. I might trade in the morning and ski in the afternoon. Although this is not necessarily a good thing, I even get up several times every night to check the markets.

Do you set your clock or do you wake up naturally?

I wake up naturally. Sometimes I see something and realize that I have to respond immediately, and I have to get out of bed. Sometimes, however, waking up to look at the markets works with my subconscious. Some of my best trades have come from looking at the quotes on my iPhone when I wake up at night and thinking, This doesn’t look right, and then going back to sleep. Then I wake up the next morning, and I realize that I shouldn’t be in a certain trade. For example, I might think, U.S. equities were strong, and the yen was down. The Nikkei should have been higher last night, and it didn’t go up. Something is wrong; I should be short.

What do you think is the biggest mistake people make in the markets?

Looking to outside sources for guidance in their positions. The belief that you can watch CNBC and get useful advice is very misguided. You really have to formulate your own opinion and not rely on so-called experts.

Do you ever have friends ask you for advice on trading?

Yes, once in a while.

Well, what advice do you give them?

I tell them that it’s not about being right; it’s about making money. Taking a loss is part of the process. You will have some percentage of losses; you just need to make sure that your losses are smaller than your wins.

At one time, I experimented with hiring traders to work for me. I had a trader who when he got stopped out of some positions in the morning would say, “My whole day is ruined.” I would reply, “What do you mean your day is ruined? You have all this opportunity sitting in front of you. The market doesn’t care if you lost money on a trade. It doesn’t matter. Think about your next trade. You have to get past the idea that just because you lost money on a trade, it means you failed. Every trading decision you make is subject to some randomness. It doesn’t matter whether you win or lose on any individual trade, as long as you get the process correct.”

What other advice do you give to friends who are aspiring traders?

You need incredible dedication. Trading is not a hobby. Treat trading like a business. Keep a journal of your trades. If you make a mistake in the markets, write it down.

About nine months later, I contacted Ramsey with a few follow-up questions.

Can you give me an actual example that illustrates your trade selection process?

The starting point is always some fundamental premise. Many investors viewed QE2 as “money printing”—a widespread perception that encouraged a shift of dollars into alternative assets including other currencies, gold, and equities.6 I actually didn’t share this view; I thought QE2 was nothing more than the Fed swapping a noninterest-bearing asset (cash) for an interest-bearing asset (a note or a bond) with the private sector. But my own views were irrelevant; it was the market perception that mattered. My expectation was that once QE2 ended, the shift of assets out of the dollar would also stop, and the dollar would recover.

Okay, so I thought the dollar should rally after QE2, but against what? I monitor at least 20 currencies against the dollar. I wanted to sell the first currency that weakened. If you think about it, under this condition of alleged “money printing,” anything that can’t rally against the dollar is really a bearish currency! The weak link turned out to be the Turkish lira, which was breaking out to a two-year low against the hated dollar.7 If it couldn’t rally versus the dollar when the Fed was “printing money” like crazy, what was it going to take?

Although I had a directional bias based on my view of the macro environment, I didn’t take the trade until the lira broke out of its two-year trading range. The market had to prove itself before the trade was entered. If there had not been a breakout, there would not have been a trade.

But what about the tendency for markets to have false breakouts?

The key distinction here is that I had a fundamental reason to expect the breakout. The breakout approximately coincided with the end of QE2. Also I used a protective stop below a recent relative low8—a point I thought should not be reached if my trade premise was correct—to limit my losses if I was wrong.

Can you give me another example of a trade that illustrates your approach?

In 2011, gold managed to rally over $500/oz., while platinum was barely able to gain $100/oz. Therefore as a trader, if my directional bias is long, I want to buy gold, and if my bias is short, then platinum stands out as the best vehicle for the trade. Novice speculators, however, would tend to do the exact opposite: They would buy platinum as a proxy for gold because “it hasn’t yet made the move.” Whatever the reason, the point is that many traders buy platinum because they are bullish gold. Buying a laggard as a proxy for a leader is a bad idea, and as a trader, I am keen to take the other side of such a trade when I see a potential setup.

In mid-August [2011] gold surged to over $1,900, a new all-time high. Platinum only managed to retest the high end of its trading range. Both markets were seriously overbought, sentiment was extreme, and there were price divergences. All of these considerations suggested that the precious metals markets were vulnerable to a steep correction. And sure enough, over the course of three days, gold corrected over $200, and platinum fell hard as well. That was the test. In the aftermath, you find out what the markets are really made of. Gold subsequently recovered quickly, and over the next couple of weeks soared $220 to a new all-time high of $1,924. Platinum, however, rebounded by only about half this amount. Platinum seemed to be a train wreck waiting to happen. I felt that platinum should lead on the downside because it was the weakest link in the precious metals complex. My strategy was to sell platinum on a downside penetration of the reaction low that had formed following the break from the 2011 high and to add on a downside breakout of an extended trading range. The beauty of selling the weak link is that this market has already shown its reluctance to make new highs. Therefore, I think the risk is the lowest, and sometimes the reward is also the highest.

These examples are very helpful. Can you give me one more?

My challenge is to pick up on the subtle nuances of the various markets and to anticipate changes or accelerations in trends. I’ve found that by observing how the markets relate to one another, you can often detect when patterns of behavior change. A change in behavior is usually a failure of one or more related markets to confirm an existing move and serves as a warning sign.

Since the 2008 financial crisis, market correlations have been extremely high. So high, in fact, that the media now simply refers to trading days as either “risk on” or “risk off.” In my opinion, the driver is usually the equity market. The typical stimulus-response pattern is:

Equities Up = Commodities Up = Dollar Down

The opposite price movements occur on “risk off” days. Furthermore, if commodities are up, then commodity currencies are up. These patterns have been unmistakable and consistent.

In mid-September [2011], however, this market behavior abruptly changed. Although stocks were closing at month-to-date highs, commodities were weaker, with the commodity index approaching year-to-date lows, and the dollar was stronger for the month. This counter-to-anticipated price action was huge! Copper, in particular, which is typically a leading indicator for the economy and commodity prices, was leading the way down, trading just above year-to-date lows, and clearly unable to benefit from the equity strength.

My strategy was simply to sell commodities and commodity currencies if they violated key technical levels—I used reaction lows and new month-to-date or year-to-date lows as the entry levels—and to risk recent reaction highs if filled. The beauty of this strategy is that if your trade entry point gets hit, you are selling the weakest markets first. They are showing that they are unable to rally in the current environment. Never sell the strongest markets until they fail.

An important lesson Ramsey provides is that even technically oriented traders—as Ramsey himself was in the early years of his career—can benefit greatly by incorporating a fundamental perspective. It is not a matter of performing any complex fundamental analysis to derive price projections, but rather a question of trying to understand the key fundamental drivers that are likely to determine the direction of the market. For example, by understanding that fundamentals were as negative as they could be for bonds at the start of 2000, Ramsey correctly assumed that bonds had very limited scope on the downside and that any weakening in the strong economy or the prevailing speculative fervor could set in motion a major bull market. As another example, Ramsey expected the end of QE2 to lead to a reversal from dollar weakness to dollar strength.

Once he has established a firm fundamental opinion, Ramsey utilizes technical analysis to confirm his anticipated scenario. Combining his technical methodology for entering and exiting trades with a strong fundamental directional bias provides Ramsey with a more effective trading approach than would be possible using technical analysis alone. The idea is to identify the big picture fundamental factors that are likely to drive the market in one direction and then to use technical analysis to trade in that direction.

Fundamentals can also be useful as a contrarian indicator. Ramsey will look for situations where there appears to be a predominant market perception that is being contradicted by the market action. Ramsey cites the example of a bond market where there was a lot of concern about government borrowing crowding out private borrowing, but interest rates failed to rise. In this context, a bearish fundamental factor had bullish price implications because of its failure to impact prices.

Ramsey will always buy the strongest market in a sector for long positions and sell the weakest market in a sector for short positions. Many novice traders make the error of doing the exact opposite. They will buy the laggards in a sector on the typically mistaken assumption that those markets haven’t yet made their move and therefore provide more potential and less risk. When Ramsey is looking for a reversal in a sector, he will focus on establishing a position in the market that lagged most on the prior price move. For example, when Ramsey anticipated the dollar would reverse to the upside at the end of QE2, he sought to sell currencies, such as the Turkish lira, that had been weak despite the prior dollar weakness.

Ramsey pays a lot of attention to price movements in related markets. The failure of a market to respond as expected to a price move in a correlated market can reveal inherent strength or weakness. For example, after years of moving together, in early September 2011, equity prices rallied, but commodity prices weakened. Ramsey read the failure of commodity prices to respond to equity market strength as a signal of impending weakness. During the second half of September, commodity prices and commodity currencies (e.g., Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian dollars) plunged.

Perhaps the hallmark of Ramsey’s trading approach is his rigorous control of risk. Ramsey will typically risk a mere 0.1 percent on each trade from point of entry. Once he is ahead on a trade, he will allow for more risk latitude. This approach all but assures that losses on new trades are likely to be quite moderate. The only time Ramsey is vulnerable to a significant monthly loss is when there are large open profits from winning trades. Although the use of a 0.1 percent stop point from entry is probably too extreme (or perhaps even inadvisable) for most traders to adopt, the general concept of using a relatively close stop on new trades and allowing a wider stop after a profit margin has been created is an effective risk management approach that could work well for many traders.

Success in trading requires dedication. Ramsey continues to trade and monitor his positions even when he is on vacation. He also awakens himself multiple times each night to check on his positions. This type of all-encompassing commitment to trading it is not necessarily recommended as a lifestyle, but rather is offered as an observation of one of the characteristics of trading success. For Ramsey, however, I suspect such commitment is not a burden, as trading is a passion, not a chore.

1The term Commodity Trading Advisor is the official designation for managers registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and members of the National Futures Association (NFA), and is a misnomer on at least two counts: (1) A CTA is a fund or account manager with direct investment responsibility and not an advisor as the name appears to suggest. (2) CTAs do not necessarily trade only commodities as the name implies. The vast majority of CTAs also trade futures contracts in one or more financial sectors including stock indexes, fixed-income, and FX. And, ironically, many CTAs do not trade any commodities at all, but trade only financial futures.

2I would argue that return/risk is a more meaningful metric than return for other strategies as well, but for futures trading this contention is a statement of fact rather than opinion.

3Commodity futures markets have a specified maximum amount the price can move on any given day—that is, the daily limit. In markets where the natural clearing price, or cash price, is below the daily limit, the market will open up limit down and not trade. Although there are lots of willing sellers, no one is willing to buy at a price that is above the cash market price. The market will remain “locked” limit down until the futures price reaches the cash market price. The episode Ramsey is referring to represents the longest string of consecutive limit down days that has ever occurred in any futures market.

5Strong economic conditions are bearish for bonds because they lead to higher interest rates.

6QE2 was the Fed’s second round of quantitative easing (buying longer-duration treasuries and other securities to lower longer-term rates) that began in November 2010 and ended in June 2011.

7In a Turkish lira/dollar chart, a new low in the lira would show up as a new high—that is, it would take more lira to buy each dollar.

8Ramsey is referring to the chart. So a relative low would represent a point of relative lira strength—that is a point at which it took less lira to buy one dollar than in prior or succeeding days.

## Chapter 5
`Jaffray Woodriff`
### The Third Way
Jaffray Woodriff knew three things: He wanted to be a trader; he wanted to use a computerized approach; he wanted to do it differently from anyone else. The majority of futures traders, called CTAs, use trend-following methodologies.1 These programs seek to identify trends and then take a position in the direction of the trend until a trade liquidation or reversal signal is received. A smaller number of systematic CTAs will use countertrend (also called mean reversion) methodologies. As the name implies, these types of systems will seek to take positions opposite to an ongoing trend when system algorithms signal that the trend is overextended. There is a third category of systematic approaches whose signals do not seek to profit from either continuations or reversals of trend. These types of systems are designed to identify patterns that suggest a greater probability for either higher or lower prices over the near term. Woodriff is among the small minority of CTAs who employ such pattern-recognition approaches, and he does so using his own unique methodology. He is one of the most successful practitioners of systematic trading of any kind.

Woodriff grew up on a working farm near Charlottesville, Virginia. Woodriff’s perceptions of work were colored by his childhood experiences. When he was in high school, Woodriff thought it was sad that most people loved Fridays and hated Mondays. “I was going to make sure that wasn’t me,” he says. “I really wanted to find a way to make Mondays as exciting as Fridays.”

Another childhood experience taught Woodriff a lesson about work incentives. One summer, he and his sister were hired by their uncle to harvest grapes in his vineyard. Initially, they worked alongside local workers. Even though they were getting paid by the quantity harvested, Woodriff was amazed that the other employees still worked slowly and wasted time. Spurred by the incentive that was directly linked to the amount of work completed, Woodriff and his sister were earning two to three times as much per hour as the other workers. Upset about the slowness at which the harvesting was progressing, his uncle eventually fired the local workers and hired migrant workers. Woodriff discovered that the migrant laborers worked so diligently and efficiently that they were earning more than twice as much as he and his sister were. Clearly, they understood incentives. Woodriff’s high regard for the fairness and efficacy of incentive-based payment is reflected in his firm’s highly unusual incentive-only fee structure (0 percent management and 30 percent incentive versus the more typical 1 percent to 2 percent management and 20 percent to 25 percent incentive).2

Woodriff attended the University of Virginia, which was only 20 miles from his family’s farm. He knew he wanted to be a trader before he graduated from college. Much to his mother’s consternation, after graduating in 1991, Woodriff never sought a job, but instead continued to apply himself to developing futures trading systems. A CTA he formed in partnership with a classmate shortly before his college graduation lasted only a few months. His partner’s family had put up the seed money for their venture, which was the reason his partner owned 65 percent of the CTA. Woodriff was amenable to the minority share, but what he had not counted on was that his partner thought he was Woodriff’s boss, an unacceptable arrangement prompting Woodriff’s quick departure.

Several months later Woodriff formed another CTA partnership, Blue Ridge Trading. Woodriff was responsible for trading, and his partner, Robert Jordan, ran the business and did the marketing. Woodriff was hardly an immediate success. Trading began in October 1991. For the first three months and the subsequent two full years, Blue Ridge ended up slightly below breakeven for the period as a whole. But then in the third year, 1994, Woodriff’s systems generated an 80 percent plus return for the first six months. Woodriff and Jordan had never bothered to sign a partnership agreement. Up to that point, they had split the firm’s small net earnings. With his systems beginning to generate significant profits, Woodriff thought it was time to formalize their business relationship with a written agreement. This decision would probably not have been problematic in itself, but the terms that Woodriff proposed so angered Jordan that he broke off the partnership and filed a lawsuit against Woodriff. Woodriff’s relationship with Blue Ridge ended shortly thereafter, and the firm was closed down a few months later.

Woodriff then established his own CTA, Woodriff Trading. He began trading in August 1994 with less than $50,000 raised from family members. In the final five months of 1994, Woodriff lost 16 percent. He then lost an additional 12 percent in 1995. But this very inauspicious beginning was followed by a spectacular 180 percent gain in 1996. The performance streak continued into 1997, as Woodriff was up another 64 percent for the first four months of the year. But in the following five months, Woodriff surrendered more than half his year-to-date profits. At the peak, assets under management had reached only $3 million. After his drawdown from the 1997 high point, losses and withdrawals had reduced assets to only about $1.5 million. Woodriff was frustrated by his inability to raise substantial assets, the 20 percent drawdown from the 1997 high, and most of all by the fact that running the CTA business in addition to trading left him with no time to pursue his true career passion: predictive modeling. Woodriff decided he might do better seeking a proprietary trading job in New York. He returned the remaining assets to his investors, closed Woodriff Trading, and moved to New York to search for a job.

A friend of Woodriff had an uncle who was a highly prominent hedge fund manager. On her own volition, she arranged for Woodriff to interview with the president of the firm. Woodriff vividly recalls this interview, which took place in what he describes as “an amazing space.” Woodriff spent about five minutes telling his story and explaining what he did. The firm’s president then spent 10 minutes telling Woodriff that they had already tried every possible combination of what he was talking about, and it didn’t work. He informed Woodriff that they didn’t have a job for him because he was not “the type of person they hire.” Woodriff laughed when he recalled his interviewer’s advice, “You are wasting your time. This is a complete dead-end for you. You really need to be thinking about jobs outside of finance. I’m so glad we had a chance to meet today and talk this through.”

A friend of a friend had arranged for Woodriff to interview at Société Générale in New York. The trader who interviewed him was setting up a desk of proprietary traders and felt that Woodriff’s approach would be completely uncorrelated to any of the other traders and therefore a good fit. Woodriff very successfully traded a proprietary account for Société Générale from 1998 until March 2000. He found that not having to deal with the business side was a great advantage in that it allowed him the time to continue his research. It was during his time at Société Générale that Woodriff first applied and began using his systematic style of trading for a long/short equity account, which was the precursor to his firm’s equity trading program.

Woodriff left Société Générale because his boss, Jonathan, was leaving to start a multimanager hedge fund operation and had invited Woodriff to join him. Jonathan had told Woodriff that three other portfolio managers would be part of the group. One of these managers had worked for George Soros and Paul Tudor Jones and was a familiar name to Woodriff. Woodriff was excited about being part of an elite trading group. In preparation for the new venture, several months earlier, Woodriff had asked Michael Geismar, a former roommate who had also worked for him at Blue Ridge, to come to New York to work as his right-hand man. Geismar prepared a trading operation. Shortly after Woodriff left Société Générale, Woodriff began trading a proprietary equity account using his system, while waiting for the hedge fund operation to launch.

Woodriff attended a meeting to discuss setting up the new multimanager fund and was surprised that he was the only one to show up besides Jonathan. When he told Geismar about the meeting, Geismar said, “You’ve got to meet these other managers.”

At the next meeting, Woodriff again found that he was the only other manager there. “Jonathan, where is everyone else?” he asked.

Jonathan replied, “Well, I have been working really hard to get everyone, but I’m afraid that it is just you and me.”

Woodriff, who had anticipated this possibility, answered, “I’m sorry Jonathan, it’s just you.”

Woodriff had gotten off to an extremely good start with his proprietary equity account, and after the hedge fund plan fell through, his intention was to just continue trading this account and live off the profits. Since Woodriff had started the account with only $300,000, and he also had to pay Geismar’s salary, I was rather incredulous when he told me this. “You weren’t planning to start a new CTA and manage client money? You were planning to just live off the profits?”

“Oh, absolutely!” he answered. His reply and his actions at the time reflected the degree of confidence he had in his system. And although it sounded like a preposterous plan to me, his confidence was not misplaced. Aided by a highly volatile equity market that was particularly favorable for his approach, in return terms, his account compounded twentyfold in the first 25 months.3

In April 2001, Woodriff and Geismar moved back to Charlottesville. As his account grew, Woodriff thought it made sense to diversify by starting another proprietary account to trade his system on the futures markets, as he had originally done. In addition, because at the time the equity account traded only on the opening, he felt that only futures would give him sufficient capacity to build a truly scalable management business if he chose to do so. The plan was to trade the futures account for two years, establish a track record and smoothly running operation, and then consider opening the program to outside investors. Woodriff emphasized the word consider because he says that, at the time, he was not at all sure he wanted to undergo the work and complications implicit in shifting from just managing his own money to establishing a money management operation. At the end of 2002, the third co-founder, Greyson Williams, joined the budding firm, and Quantitative Investment Management (QIM) as a company was officially established in May 2003. As it turned out, Woodriff never got to the two-year decision point. In late 2003, a broker recommended QIM to a client, and Woodriff, along with Geismar and Williams, decided they were ready to manage other people’s money.

QIM trades a futures program and an equity program, and both have exhibited strong return/risk performance. The futures trading program accounts for about 85 percent of the near $5 billion of assets under management. From the October 2003 start date for the first client account through 2011, the futures trading program achieved an average annual compounded return of 12.5 percent, with an annualized standard deviation of 10.5 percent, and a strong Gain to Pain ratio (GPR) of 1.43. (See Appendix A for an explanation of the GPR.) A proprietary account trading the futures program, which has a longer track record (inception: December 2001) and trades at much greater leverage than the client accounts, has realized an average annual compounded return of 118 percent, with an annualized standard deviation of 81 percent and a GPR of 1.94. (Besides the difference in start dates, the higher GPR is a consequence of the absence of performance fee charges on the proprietary account.) The track record for QIM’s equity program consists of nonoverlapping proprietary and client accounts. The proprietary account, which traded between April 2000 and September 2005, had an average annual compounded return of 115 percent, with a 69 percent annualized standard deviation and a very high GPR of 2.69. Since its inception in May 2008, the equity program for client accounts had an average annual compounded return of 34 percent, with an annualized standard deviation of 20 percent and a very high GPR of 2.38.

Woodriff emphasizes that co-founders Michael Geismar and Greyson Williams have been critical to QIM’s success. He is also extremely proud of the fact that QIM has had zero turnover in staff since its inception. (There are currently 31 employees.)

I interviewed Woodriff at his firm, QIM, located in Charlottesville, Virginia, a pretty college town. We talked in Woodriff’s office, which was noteworthy for the number of books scattered everywhere, with several stacks on the low table between us. Many of these books were still new. Woodriff is clearly a voracious reader. My impression was that he buys any book that catches his interest and leaves it in plain sight so he will eventually get to it. Woodriff is 42, but looks much younger. If I didn’t know him in context of being the founder of QIM, I would sooner have guessed that he was in his late twenties than in his early forties. Woodriff had looked forward to our meeting and was extremely disappointed that he had come down with a bad cold a day earlier. He repeatedly apologized for what he considered his foggy thinking and imprecise recollections. “God, I wish I weren’t sick. I’m not thinking clearly,” he said.4

How did you get interested in developing computerized trading systems?

When I was about 9 or 10 years old, I became interested in odds and probability. I would obsessively roll a pair of dice to see seven win, and six and eight duke it out. It just fascinated me to see the results come out over time—to see the randomness, but also the certainty with which seven would always beat six and eight.

When I was 12, I read about computers. It was an article about the new Commodore, a $300 computer, which in today’s terms would be several thousand dollars. I convinced my parents to buy the computer for me, but because it was so expensive, they agreed only on the condition that I return it in time for the 30-day money back guarantee. It was that or no computer at all for me. This Commodore was the type of computer where you saved your files on a cassette tape, which I thought was really neat technology. The thing I wanted to program was rolling dice, so I could roll dice faster. It felt a little weird having a computer decide what was random and not seeing the dice, but it was fun writing the program. To get more time on the computer before I had to return it, I even skipped school for a couple of days by pretending to be sick, using the old thermometer-near-the-lightbulb trick.

How did you teach yourself programming?

I think there was some sort of manual. Also, it was such a simple program except for the random number generation, which was a function already programmed on the computer. Even though I begged my parents to keep the computer, they sent it back. But I am really glad I got to do 30 days of programming back then. I think it was a really good thing for my evolving brain to experience. I did very little programming again until college.

Were any other childhood experiences influential in your becoming a trading system developer?

Absolutely! A year earlier, I had gotten really interested in baseball statistics after my grandfather, who lives in Pennsylvania, took me to see the Philadelphia Phillies, my favorite baseball team. I calculated and recorded full-page statistics on the Phillies from the box scores in the newspaper after every game. This early experience shows how diligent I was with numbers very early on if I became excited about something. Beginning when I was 12, I read Bill James’s Baseball Abstract cover to cover each year. He was creating and quantifying new and interesting statistics. I don’t remember the details now, but James created statistics that gave you more information and were more predictive. For example, if you had a 21-year-old hit .311, that was more interesting than a 26-year-old with the same batting average. In retrospect, Bill James’s style of quantitative analysis was a very important influence in how I eventually ended up thinking about the process of building trading systems to predict the markets. After having been dismissed for several decades, over the past 10 years, Bill James’s analytical style has been recognized and deployed by the baseball establishment.

What is the connection between what Bill James did for baseball statistics and your approach to trading systems?

James was creative in coming up with better measures. For example, the first batter in the rotation, who batted after the worst hitters, would have fewer opportunities for RBIs than the batter in the fourth position. James would do normalizations for those types of disparities. He would find leadoff batters who would have had a lot of RBIs once you adjusted for their batting slot and who therefore should have been batting third or fourth. I loved the logic of normalizing data.

When did you first get involved in the markets?

When I was born, my family put money for me in a managed trust. When I was 18, I started checking the prices of the stocks in my trust account in the daily paper. I checked it for a few days, and it bored me because the prices didn’t change much from day to day. But I noticed that the option prices moved much more, that is, in percentage terms. At that time, the most liquid options were the OEX, which were options on the S&P 100 index. I talked my dad into opening an account for me with $2,500. My broker recommended a trade to me, in typical broker fashion. “It’s a layup,” he assured me. It lost money, and I never followed another broker’s recommendation in my entire life. Boom. Done. One trade; I will never do it again.

What was the trade he recommended?

I don’t even remember if it was a stock or an option. All that I remember is that he was so sure of it, and it didn’t work. Then I started looking at how I might be able to predict the direction of the market.

What did you trade?

I basically traded the OEX options. I only did one stock trade that I can recall. I was away on the day of the October 19, 1987, crash. When I got back the following morning, the market was down even more. I had been watching a tech company that a family friend had recommended, which had run up from $20 to $40. I had wanted to buy it much lower, but never did because it just kept going up. On the morning of the 20th, the price had fallen all the way back into the low teens. I called the 800 number for Schwab at least 50 times to try to place my order, and I kept getting a busy signal. Finally I got through. I gave my account number to the woman who answered and said, “I want to buy 100 shares of CHPS.”

She said, “Okay, account number so and so you are selling 100 shares of CHPS.”

I excitedly answered back, “No, no, buy!”

She said, “You must mean sell. No one is buying!”

And I again said, “No, I want to buy, B-U-Y.”

She said in a surprised voice, “Really? Everyone’s selling.”

I answered, “I’m buying.” So she placed the order, and it was filled at $14.50, after which it rallied sharply. I think what is significant about that trade is that it shows I was willing to be a contrarian even at the very beginning.

On what basis were you doing your option trades?

There, too, I was a contrarian. I used the put/call ratio as my primary indicator. I really liked the logic of it. I also watched the ARMS Index.

Is there something about your personality that is contrarian?

I just can’t stand being part of the herd and simply accepting the consensus. I want to evaluate everything on my own.

How did you do in your trading?

It’s funny. I was looking through my old brokerage statements this morning before you came in, and I was surprised to discover that the memory of my first trades had become distorted. I had been under the impression that my first 10 option trades all made money. However, what I found out in checking the brokerage statements was that it was actually my first 10 put trades that made money. But I had also been buying calls, and most of those trades lost money. I had conveniently forgotten that it was the long put positions that made money, not all the trades. Of course, we were in a down market at the time, so it wasn’t surprising that the long put positions consistently made money. I now feel I need to go back to anyone I ever told that my first 10 trades were profitable and set the record straight. Up to that point, on balance, I had still done very well, because the put trades had made a lot of money. My starting $2,500 account had more than quadrupled to over $10,000. Then, on my 11th put trade, I lost more money than I made on the first 10 put trades combined.

What happened on the 11th put trade?

The market rallied sharply, so the puts expired worthless.

Since you were a buyer of puts, why would you have lost so much on one trade?

Because I kept on increasing my trade size as I made money.

So you blew it all on one trade?

Yeah.

Did that trade end your trading at the time?

No, I continued to trade, but I didn’t do that well. That summer I tried daytrading. I got a whole real-time quote setup. My plan was to spend the summer staring at the trading screen. After about the third day of doing that, I realized, This isn’t me. This just doesn’t work for me.

Did you have any idea what you wanted to do when you were in college?

I wanted to trade. When I was a junior in college I competed in the AT&T investment challenge, which was a real-time trading contest for college students. There was a $50 entry fee. I entered under my own name, and I also entered under my roommate’s name. I wanted to get my roommate, Will, to enter the contest as well, but he had no interest in trading. So I did a second entry under his name. I traded the two accounts differently to increase my odds of winning. There were 10 winning slots, and I came in sixth, but it was on Will’s entry. The sixth place prize was $3,000. In addition to the cash prizes, the top 10 winners also won a weeklong trip to the Bahamas for themselves and a companion. I told Will, “You have to accept the prize. It’s under your name.”

Was there an official prize ceremony?

Oh, yeah.

Who went up to get the prize?

Will did. The prize check they gave Will was about this big.

[Woodriff draws a large rectangular shape in the air with his hands.]

The next morning, we went to the local bank to try to cash it. The check wouldn’t fit through the teller window.

I don’t get it. They gave you an oversized check?

It was a mock check, but we didn’t realize it because it looked official. We were hung over, and we were idiots. It just didn’t occur to either one of us that the check was just a prop. We received the real check in the mail later.

I felt really guilty that I had played two hands to win the trading contest. On the fifth day, there was a picnic, and I went up to one of the two guys running the event and confessed to him that I had entered twice. “Are you kidding me?” he said. “We wish everyone would enter 10 times. We want people to do multiple accounts and try different strategies. You didn’t have to enter under your friend’s name.”

Did you have any game plan of how you wanted to get into trading?

I quickly figured out that I didn’t want to be a broker working for commissions or a money manager working just for management fees. The incentive fee structure appealed to me. I liked the idea of having your pay directly linked to how well you did.

Besides knowing your preferred fee structure, did you have any idea of how you planned to trade the markets?

I knew there was a very good chance I might not be able to figure out how to beat the markets, but I also knew there were some people who were beating the markets, thanks to your first Market Wizards book and other sources. As soon as I learned about the efficient market hypothesis, I was on a mission to prove it wrong.

Right around that time, I took a course in economics. I was horrified by some of the conclusions academics had come to, such as the efficient market hypothesis. I refused to learn the material because I thought a lot of it was wrong. The professor had given multiple-choice tests throughout the course. I pleaded with him to use essay questions instead of multiple-choice questions for the final exam. A week before the exam, he announced that it would be multiple choice. I was so frustrated that I decided to take the final exam with a box of crayons on my desk, and I made sure to sit up front, so everyone could see it. I wrote a note on the exam explaining that I was answering the questions with what I thought were the right answers, but that for those questions where I thought he was looking for a different answer, I would explain why I thought he was wrong and write that answer in a separate column. I also wrote that I would fail the exam if he went straight down the line and didn’t pay attention to the alternative answers I provided. He ignored everything I wrote and just went straight down the line. He gave me a failing grade of 51. I don’t really care that much about getting a 51—in fact I’m glad I did—because I know how wrong some of the “correct” answers were.

Did you have any mentors?

People ask me all the time if I had any mentors. The truth is that I am self-taught. I have thought through this so many ways, and there is no other way to put it. But if you ask me what manager I set out to emulate, it’s clearly Paul Tudor Jones. It has nothing to do with his trading style, because I learned pretty early on that I had no interest in being a discretionary trader. Right around the time I read Market Wizards, he came to give a talk at Darden, University of Virginia’s graduate business school. He wasn’t that famous then.

Do you remember anything specific about his talk that had an influence?

I remember his confidence, his charisma, and that I liked him, but that is about it. I loved the fact that he was a University of Virginia graduate.

How did you originally develop your trading system?

After I graduated from the University of Virginia, I didn’t have my own computer, so I used the computers at the engineering school. The computer lab was this huge room with extremely high ceilings—I don’t know what it had been used for before—filled with over 100 computers. I started looking at trend-following models, which was kind of interesting, but I thought there were already lots of successful trend followers out there, and I didn’t want to compete with them. I wanted to do something different.

Just from our conversation so far, it is clear to me that there was another reason why you wouldn’t have pursued a trend-following approach. It would have been totally out of character for you. A trading approach that, by definition, requires staying with the herd would have been exactly opposite your natural instincts. Even if it worked, you would have had trouble following it.

That’s true. My contrarian nature was opposed to doing what other people were doing. I also believed that if everyone thought trend following worked, it would start to work less well. I was never going to be a trend follower. That was clear. Mean reversion was more interesting. But I didn’t like mean reversion either.

Why didn’t you like mean reversion?

Because I found something that worked much better. Right then. Right in that computer lab. [Woodriff speaks these words very emphatically, conveying this was a pivotal moment in his life.]

What did you find?

I had the realization that I could build a whole third class of models that were trend neutral on average—that is, trading models that were neither trend following nor countertrend. I built a couple of these models and did some preliminary tests. I came to the conclusion that there was a lot of edge in this type of approach.

Out of my sheer excitement in discovering this style of model—an approach that still remains at the core of what I do today—I couldn’t wait to do more extensive testing. To speed things up, I was working on two computers. But then the lab got crowded, and I had to give up one. I started thinking, This place is going to empty out sometime tonight. I decided to get all my data prepared so that I could simultaneously use many of the lab’s computers that night. I was very excited about the idea. People started to leave, and then I had two computers, then four, and eventually I was jumping between 20 computers running my backtests.

Were you testing your system on one market on each computer?

That is exactly what I was doing. I was so excited about the results I was getting that I worked all night and continued through the next day. It was going so well that I pulled a second all-nighter. I worked for nearly 40 hours straight, keeping myself awake with the caffeine from drinking a Pepsi every hour. I was still living on the farm at the time. It was dangerous driving home on the second morning. I remember almost falling asleep at the wheel a couple of times. I got home, took about 3 minutes to tell my father what I had accomplished, and then went to bed. I slept for 24 hours straight. When I woke up, I felt completely refreshed. I remember sometime later reading that you can’t catch up on your sleep and thinking, Not true!

What did you do next?

I went back to the computer lab and continued cranking, although I didn’t pull any more all-nighters.

Did you make any further discoveries?

I discovered that it was much better to use multiple models than a single best model.

Sometime after that week with the two consecutive all-nighters when I had that feeling, “Whoa, I think I’ve got it,” I told my mom, “I know you are really frustrated that I didn’t interview for jobs after graduating college, and that instead, I am trying to do this trading thing, which I realize you think is crazy. But I want you to know that if I am successful in what I am working on right now, I will do very well with it. I don’t want you to think that I’m doing this just to make money. The really great thing about what I’m doing now is that if I am that good at applying predictive modeling, I will be able to generalize the same approach into science. So I won’t just be a trader, even if I am very successful at it. And the more successful I am at it, the better the chance it will generalize to science.”

Did you ever apply it to science?

I have set up a foundation called the Quantitative Foundation. The long-term plan is to improve statistical prediction methodologies and software. I prefer the terms statistical prediction or statistical learning to data mining, which has deservedly earned a negative connotation through its misuse.5 We haven’t done much so far, but we didn’t plan on doing anything yet, since we are still in the phase of making money from our edge in these techniques, as opposed to going out and building software for scientists. We want to build the software so that it is not a gift to our competitors.

How do you get around the problem that if you supplied the software for scientific applications, other people could use it as a predictive tool in the financial markets, which would presumably reduce the edge you are currently profiting from?

It is going to take a number of years to develop the generalized software from the time we fully engage in this endeavor—possibly as long as five years or more. Maybe by that time, QIM will be closed for some reason. If QIM were to go through a long stretch of poor performance, and we decided to close it down, it wouldn’t invalidate the predictive modeling techniques I have come up with. In some ways, it would actually validate them by showing that it was possible to have an edge for many years, and finally other people caught up and found the same things we did and knocked those inefficiencies out of the market. That would probably be a good time to offer predictive software for more general use. But it is not a question I have to grapple with now because I am nowhere near the goal of having generalized predictive modeling software to provide to scientists in a wide variety of disciplines and domains. We are building a war chest to do that eventually. We started the foundation with $50 million, and there is about $100 million now.

So what is your foundation doing now?

As a foundation, we still have to give away a specified percentage of money every year.

Where does the money go to?

So far the money has been given to schools and local charities.

So the main project of the foundation is something that you would focus on in the post-QIM portion of your life.

That’s the general concept, although there are interesting scenarios in which the predictive modeling project could operate in parallel with QIM.

When you first started managing money under Blue Ridge, for the three months in your inception year and the subsequent two full years, you were actually down slightly on balance. Then in the first six months of the following year, you were up over 80 percent. That is such a stark contrast in performance that it seems that something significant must have changed in your trading approach during those early years. Was there some major change to your methodology during this period, and if so what was it?

I started out using market-specific models. I ended up realizing that these models were far more vulnerable to breaking down in actual trading because they were more prone to being overfitted to the past data. In 1993, I started to figure out that the more data I used to train the models, the better the performance. I found that using the same models across multiple markets provided a far more robust approach. So the big change that occurred during this period was moving from separate models for each market to common models applied across all markets. The second change that occurred was increased diversification. I started out trading only two markets and then for some time traded only three markets. But as assets under management increased, and I realized it was best to use the same models across all markets, I added substantially more markets to the portfolio. The transition to greater diversification also helped improve performance. By 1994, I was trading about 20 markets, and I was no longer using market-specific models. Those changes made a big difference.

When you were only trading two or three markets, how did you decide which markets to trade?

That was part of the problem. I was cherry-picking the markets that looked best in backtesting.

It sounds like you were still making some rookie curve-fitting mistakes at that time.

Absolutely. I was still making some very bad data mining errors in those initial years.

Was the system you were using at Blue Ridge after you switched to using the same models on all markets an early version of what you ended up doing at QIM?

It was similar, but much less sophisticated—fewer models generated with far less computing power.

But it was conceptually similar?

Oh, absolutely. It was the same thing. It was just a very early version of it.

How did you come up with the idea for systems that seem to work well and that were neither trend following nor mean reversion?

[Woodriff looks for one of the many books stacked throughout his office, and finding it, begins to talk about it. Ironically, it is a book that he has not yet read.]

Before you go there, I asked you the question about how . . .

Oh, yeah, I was trying to avoid that question.

I know. [Woodriff laughs.] But I am not supposed to let you do that. Part of your breakthrough was your idea of trying to find common systems that work stably across markets. Another important concept was to trade multiple systems instead of a single system. But neither of those two ideas is unique. Probably the majority of CTAs trade multiple systems, and a substantial percentage of CTAs also use the same systems across different markets. Those two elements are no doubt critical, but they are not by themselves the key. They don’t differentiate you from a large segment of CTAs. Whatever your special sauce is would lie in the system concepts you came up with.

I wanted to set up a structure that would allow me to try out a huge number of combinations. When I first started out, I could only try out thousands of combinations, but as computing power dramatically increased over the years, I was eventually able to try out trillions of combinations. But it was critical to do that without overfitting the systems to the data.

I finally found a way. There are books about the predictive modeling process that specifically caution against “burning the data”—that is, you have to greatly limit the number of combinations you ever try. And I found that advice markedly stupid because I knew I could find a way to try any number of combinations and not overfit the data. You get new out-of-sample data every day. If you are rigorous about acknowledging what that new data is telling you, you can really get somewhere. It may take a while. If you are trading the system, and it is not performing in line with expectations over some reasonable time frame, look for overfit and hindsight errors. If you are expecting a Sharpe ratio above 1, and you are getting a Sharpe ratio under 0.3, it means that you have made one or more important hindsight errors, or badly misjudged trading costs. I was using the data up to a year before the current date as the training data set, the final year data as the validation data set, and the ongoing real-time data as the test. Effectively, the track record became the test data set.

I understand why you would look for a method that was not trend following, given your aversion to following the herd, but why would you inherently avoid a mean reversion approach?

For the same reason I didn’t pursue trend following—namely, other people were doing the same type of thing. Mean reversion may have been a better fit for me than trend following, but I wanted my own style. I wanted an approach that fit my personality, which is a very important point that I got out of one of your first two Market Wizards books. Mean reversion partially fit my personality, but because people knew about it, it didn’t fully fit my personality. So I looked for other ways to crunch the numbers that would be neither trend following nor mean reversion.

Without giving away trade secrets, what is the essence of that third approach?

I was trying different combinations of secondary variables that I generate from the daily price data.

Can you give me an example of what you mean by secondary variables?

An example would be a volatility measure, which is a data series that is derived from price, but has no direct relationship to price direction. I got the idea for secondary variables from Bill James.

What is the connection between what Bill James did with baseball statistics and what you call secondary variables?

James was taking the basic data and formulating different types of statistics that were more informative, and I was taking the price data and defining different quantifications derived from that data, that is, secondary variables, that could be combined to provide useful market signals.

Are all your secondary variables derived just from daily open, high, low, and close price data?

Absolutely. That is all I am using.

You don’t throw in any other statistics, such as GNP or any other economic variables?

If I could, I would. I actually tried that, but I couldn’t get it to work.

How would generating these secondary variables give you a trading system?

I combined different secondary variables into trend-neutral models.

What do you mean by a trend-neutral model?

They were neither trying to project a continuation of the trend or a reversal of the trend. They were only trying to predict the probable market direction over the next 24 hours.

How many models are there in your system?

There are over a thousand.

Since there are so many, could you give me an example of just one trend-neutral model to provide a better idea of what you mean? I assume giving away just one out of a thousand models wouldn’t reveal a meaningful amount of the system.

The issue is that the models share common characteristics. It is hard to give you an example without jeopardizing our intellectual property.

Is your system discovery process a matter of seeing patterns in the market and then testing whether they worked, or is it a matter of coming up with theoretical hypotheses and then testing them to see if they worked?

I know what to grab.

[He gets up again in search of another book—this time it is one of mine, Stock Market Wizards. He flips through pages and then finds the spot he is looking for.]

This is really key. I wouldn’t spend the time to do this unless it was really important.

[Woodriff begins reading my interview with David Shaw. He flips through a few excerpts and then reads the following response by Shaw to my question of how he can tell whether a market pattern represents something real as opposed to a chance occurrence.]

The more variables you have, the greater the number of statistical artifacts that you’re likely to find, and the more difficult it will generally be to tell whether a pattern you uncover actually has any predictive value. We take great care to avoid methodological pitfalls associated with “overfitting the data.” . . . Rather than blindly searching through the data for patterns—an approach whose methodological dangers are widely appreciated within, for example, the natural science and medical research communities—we typically start by formulating a hypothesis based on some sort of structural theory or qualitative understanding of the market, and then test that hypothesis to see whether it is supported by the data.

[Woodriff speaking emphatically] I don’t do that. I read all of that just to get to the point that I do what I am not supposed to do, which is a really interesting observation because I am supposed to fail. According to almost everyone, you have to approach systematic trading (and predictive modeling in general) from the framework of “Here is a valid hypothesis that makes sense within the context of the markets.” Instead, I blindly search through the data.

It’s nice that people want hypotheses that make sense. But I thought that was very limiting. I want to be able to search the rest of the stuff. I want to automate that process. If you set the problem up really well with cross validation, then overfitting is a problem that can be overcome. I hypothesized that there are patterns that work, and I would rather have the computer test trillions of patterns than just a few hundred that I had thought of.

There is one aspect of the process, though, that is manual. The secondary variables that are used to construct price-forecasting models have to make sense. For example, it makes sense that price-derived data series, such as volatility or price acceleration, might provide important information. The list of secondary variables derived from price is the part I built manually. Then I have a framework for combining the secondary variables in all sorts of combinations to see what works.

I wanted to hand that work off to the computer, but I knew how important it was to have the hindsight bias and overfit problem figured out. As an aside, I am still trying to reverse engineer some of the models that we have come up with that are so interesting and amazing. What do these patterns say about the psychology of the marketplace? Frankly, I’m not sure yet.

You are constructing models by selecting combinations of secondary variables formed from a list of hundreds of possible secondary variables. Depending on the specific selection constraints you use, there would be millions if not billions of possible combinations. Superficially, selecting 1,000 models from such a large list of possibilities sounds very much like a data mining process.

Data mining can be a very positive process. It is just that most people who do data mining are terrible at it. There are various things that you can do to make the data mining process work. It doesn’t work on every data set. For some data sets, there is simply no edge available. Luckily for me, my intuition that there was an edge available in a nontrend following, noncountertrend type of model was correct. My intuition was that there should be other emergent patterns in the price data that are more complex than trend following.

What are some of the things you can do to avoid the pitfalls of data mining?

The first thing you need to do is to get some idea of how much of the apparent edge is completely spurious.

How do you do that?

Let’s say instead of training with the target variable, which is the price change over the subsequent 24 hours, I generate random numbers that have the same distribution characteristics. I know that any models that I find that score well training on this data are 100 percent curve-fitted because they are based on intentionally bogus data. The performance of the best model on the fictitious data provides a baseline. Then, you need to come up with models that do much better than this baseline when you are training on the real data. It is only the performance difference between the models using real data and the baseline that is indicative of expected performance, not the full performance of the models in training.

What are some of the worst errors people make in data mining?

A lot of people think they are okay because they use in-sample data for training and out-of-sample data for testing.6 Then they sort the models based on how they performed on the in-sample data and choose the best ones to test on the out-of-sample data. The human tendency is to take the models that continue to do well in the out-of-sample data and choose those models for trading. That type of process simply turns the out-of-sample data into part of the training data because it cherry-picks the models that did best in the out-of-sample period. It is one of the most common errors people make and one of the reasons why data mining as it is typically applied yields terrible results.

What should you be doing instead?

You can look for patterns where, on average, all the models out-of-sample continue to do well. You know you are doing well if the average for the out-of-sample models is a significant percentage of the in-sample score. Generally speaking, you are really getting somewhere if the out-of-sample results are more than 50 percent of the in-sample. QIM’s business model would never have worked if SAS and IBM were building great predictive modeling software.

Because if they did, lots of people could use this software for financial modeling?

And lots of people do, but they have a very tough time modeling properly with the software, and they end up doing data mining of the bad kind.

Why do you think you as a single individual have been able to come up with data mining procedures that are much more effective in financial markets than the software produced by these large corporations with tons of PhDs?

Because the commercial software is focused more on the problem of allowing users to handle large quantities of data than on providing users with very strict protocols to make sure they don’t curve-fit the data. People are so excited about building and using software that allows them to handle so much more data than ever before that they are missing the point of doing the process properly. Not only does the software fail to guide the user in doing data mining correctly, it actually leads users in the wrong direction because it allows them to generate bogus evidence to support their pet theories.

Do you give the same weight to data from the 1980s as data from the 2000s?

Sometimes we give a little more weight to more recent data, but it is amazing how valuable older data still is. The stationarity of the patterns we have uncovered is amazing to me, as I would have expected predictive patterns in markets to change more over the longer term.

Is the implication then that models don’t get dropped even if they perform poorly?

It takes a tremendous amount of deterioration to drop a model. We don’t react to the short-term results of a model because the current year performance of any single model is simply not at all predictive of the next year’s performance. What is predictive is how the model performed over the entire 31 years. The extra 3 percent of data provided by the most recent year doesn’t make much difference in how a model has performed over the entire training period.

Your assets under management in the futures program alone have been as high as $5 billion. Is capacity a problem? Do you have to make changes to accommodate larger assets under management?

One of the changes we have made from the early years, which has greatly expanded capacity, is to execute trades throughout the trading session as opposed to only on the opening. Another change that has increased our capacity is that we have shifted the allocation process to give greater weight to more liquid markets. We trade a larger percentage in stock indexes and interest rates than we used to and a smaller percentage in nonfinancial futures contracts. Although this change has reduced our diversification, we were quite willing to make it because there is a strong pattern for our edge to be greater in more liquid markets. So besides increasing capacity, the shift to allocating a greater percentage to more liquid markets has also improved performance.

Are you then sizing your positions in each market based on relative liquidity?

We started shifting our weightings to the more liquid markets in 2006 and about six months ago we switched our risk weightings to be exclusively based on liquidity, with the one exception being the S&P, which has very substantial excess capacity.

The other important point that needs to be made about capacity is that it is not static; it moves around a lot with changes in volume and volatility in the underlying markets. We estimate our current capacity at $6 billion to $9 billion. But we always add the caveat that if volatilities decline by 50 percent on average across the markets, our capacity would be reduced by a similar amount.

How do you control risk?

The core of the risk management is evaluating the risk of each market based on an exponentially weighted moving average of the daily dollar range per contract. This risk management metric has kept our volatility relatively stable near the target level, even through periods of wide gyrations in the markets. One of the things I’m particularly proud of in terms of risk management is that through the chaos of 2008 and 2009 our volatility remained very near our target level of 12 percent annualized.

I assume then that you were trading a much smaller number of contracts in each market per million dollars in 2008 than you normally do?

Absolutely. As volatility increased, the number of contracts we were trading dropped precipitously.

What other risk management procedures do you use besides adjusting the trading size for changes in the volatility of the underlying markets?

The volatility adjustment has worked extremely well for the entire history of the program. The part of our risk management process that has worked poorly during the past two years is our leverage reduction policy. In its initial formulation, whenever there was an intramonth drawdown of 6 percent from a monthly equity peak, we cut our exposure to 75 percent of normal.7 On an 8 percent drawdown, the exposure was cut to 50 percent, and on a 10 percent drawdown, it was cut to 25 percent. Then there were analogous rules for increasing exposure back up as the drawdown was reduced. From 2003 through 2009, the leverage reduction rule very slightly lowered our return/risk, but it made it much easier to sleep because whenever we were in a significant drawdown, our trading size would be smaller. However, in 2010 and 2011, our leverage-reduction policy really hurt us badly because the periods when our models were really on fire occurred when our exposure was lowest. To borrow a term from trend following, we were whipsawed by our own risk overlay.

That is the dilemma, isn’t it? If you believe that mean reversion applies to the performance of trading systems, then if a system doesn’t work well for a period of time, there is probably a greater-than-normal probability that it will do well in the subsequent period. Yet, if you are reducing your risk after a drawdown, that would be the exact time when you would have your smallest exposure. On the other hand, there is the argument that by reducing exposure on drawdowns, you reduce the risk of ruin. Ironically, I think that both perspectives are true—reducing exposure after losses will mitigate the chances of a catastrophic loss, but it will do so at the cost of adversely impacting performance.

What misconceptions do people have about markets?

The worst misconception is about what should constitute the “free market.” In the name of free markets, the over-the-counter (OTC) market continues to grow without bounds as a massive profit center for Wall Street banks. Allowing the OTC markets to be unregulated and opaque makes as much sense as leaving 50 eight-year-olds unsupervised for a month. The OTC markets are very often used to take advantage of clients who are “sophisticated” in the legal definition, but are naive in practice. The OTC markets have been built to maximize asymmetries of information and are an example of how markets should not operate. Markets should be fair and transparent, as the futures and equities markets have mostly evolved to be.

What are the worst mistakes the public makes in markets?

Overtrading and listening to tips.

Do losing periods cause any emotional strain? How do you handle it?

Yes, periods of poor performance are difficult. I generally handle it by focusing very hard on improving the trading system.

How would you summarize the trading rules you live by?

Look where others don’t. Adjust position sizes to overall risk to target a particular volatility. Pay careful attention to transaction costs.

Any final words?

When I was in my teens, my highly insightful father was somehow able to instill in me the discipline of objectively evaluating your own progress. That lesson, more than anything else, has been critical to my success.

Woodriff’s views, confirmed by his long-term success, provide four important insights about trading systems:

1. It is possible to find systems that are neither trend following nor countertrend that work better than either of those more common approaches (judging by the comparison of Woodriff’s return/risk to the return/risk of the universe of systematic traders).
2. It is possible to apply data mining techniques to search huge quantities of data to find useful patterns without necessarily falling victim to curve fitting. (Although, as an important caveat, most people trying to do so will misuse the approach and end up finding patterns that worked very well in the past, but fail in actual trading.)
3. Old price data (e.g., data 30 years old) can be nearly as meaningful as recent data.
4. Systems that work well across many markets are more likely to continue to work in actual trading than systems that do well in specific markets. The lesson is: Design systems that work broadly rather than market-specific systems.
Woodriff’s core risk management technique—adjusting position sizes in line with changing overall volatility—has applicability to a wide range of traders, even those who don’t use a systematic approach. As markets become more volatile, Woodriff will trade a smaller number of contracts for the same asset size. Woodriff uses the average dollar range in contract value for each market traded as the metric for adjusting portfolio exposure. Using this approach, Woodriff has been able to maintain his portfolio volatility close to the desired target level, despite widely fluctuating volatility over the past 20 years.

As I have found to be true of virtually all successful traders, Woodriff developed a methodology that suited his personality. He felt a deep inner need to develop an approach that was different from what anyone else was doing, and that is what he did. He was also able to recognize from very early on when a methodology didn’t suit him. After setting up a real-time quote system to manually day-trade the markets, he abandoned the process after only three days, as he quickly realized, This isn’t me. This just doesn’t work for me.

1Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) are managers who trade futures and are registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This official nomenclature is poorly chosen on at least two grounds: Commodity Trading Advisors are managers, not advisors, and a large majority of the trading they engage in is in financial markets (e.g., stock indexes, interest rates, and currencies) rather than commodities.

2Management fees are collected on assets under management. Incentive fees are collected as a percent of profits earned above a high-water mark—the highest NAV level at which incentive fees were previously collected. Almost all CTAs and hedge funds charge both types of fees; Woodriff charges a higher-than-normal incentive fee, but no management fee.

3The actual account compounded by a lesser amount because Woodriff was withdrawing money from the account to cover his living expenses and pay Geismar.

4Woodriff was the first interview I conducted for this book and also the last chapter I completed. A little more than a year later, I sent Woodriff the completed chapter to check for accuracy. His e-mail back finished on the following ironic note: “If you can believe it, coming full circle for this chapter, I am coming down with another bad cold right now and my head is fogging up!”

5Data mining refers to the process of using computers to analyze large amounts of data to discover patterns in the data. Although data mining techniques can uncover patterns in data that would be impossible for humans to find empirically or by prior hypotheses, it can also identify meaningless patterns that are nothing more than chance occurrences or the product of flaws in the analytical process. When searching very large numbers of combinations of past price data for patterns, it is easy to come up with many patterns that worked well in the past simply by chance, but have no predictive value. This common pitfall of applying data mining to price data is the reason why the term often has derogatory connotations in reference to trading systems.

6To avoid hindsight bias error in developing trading systems, the available past data is segmented into seen data (i.e., “in-sample”) that is used for system development and unseen data (i.e., “out-of-sample”) that is used for system testing. Any results on the in-sample data are ignored because they are hindsight-biased. Although segmenting the data to reserve unseen data for testing is a necessary condition to avoid misleading results, it is not a sufficient condition as Woodriff goes on to explain.

7In 2011, QIM changed the exact calculation it used to reduce leverage during periods of poor performance, but the new formulation was similar in both conceptual and practical terms. It is, therefore, simpler to talk about their leverage reduction as one process.
