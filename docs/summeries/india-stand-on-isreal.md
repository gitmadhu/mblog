  Today the conflict between Israel and Palestine is a matter of great importance.
what's going to happen next what's ahead of the road that is something we certainly don't know yet
## two
But what is India's stand in this issue, who should India support, to conclude that we should go back to when it all started
For India we should analyze India's relationship with Israel and Palestine simultaneously, and see who ditched us and who supported us when we
Indians were in need.

As soon as Hamas attacked Israel on 7th October Indian prime minister Mr Modi tweeted in
support of Israel and it's a well-known fact that Israel is one of the biggest exporters of military equipments in India 
and #(hashtag) #IndiaStandsWithIsrael has been trending for so long,

So now it may look like India stands more on the side of Israel but the situation was completely different 75 years back 


after British left Palestine in 1948 the Arab Muslims and Jews started
fighting with each other demanding their own country.

The United Nations intervened in the issue and partition the country into two and there was a strong
opposition for this from India since it was divided on the basis of religious terms,

But the irony is India too was divided on the basis of religion on top
of that Mahatma Gandhi believed that the Arabs were the rightful occupants of
Palestine he said in 1938 Palestine belongs to the Arab in the same sense that England belongs to the English or
the France to the French.

So in 1947 India stand was against the partition of Palestine however partition happened yet India refused to recognize Israel as a country
 and in 1949 India voted against Israel's entry into the United Nations 
Then in 1950 2 years after the formation of Israel the then prime minister
javahar neru accepted to recognize Israel as a country and we were one of the Lost non-muslim countries to do so

But even then India was not ready to establish any kind of diplomatic relationship with Israel on the other
hand India was the first non-arab country to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization that is PLO in
1974 and when Palestine was formed as a country in 1988 India immediately recognized its formation.

So back in that time India strongly supported Palestine over Israel why so because India wanted
to show its support to the Arabs and not hurt their sentiments, then how did things change later what exactly happened.
 
 Israel slowly started gaining the trust of India while Arab Nations lost it gradually, in 1953 Israel was
granted permission to open its Consulate in Bombay just for the immigration of Indian Jews to Israel 

2 years later in 1955 India and Indonesia organized a conference for newly independent states in that conference 
Nehru proposed inviting Israel as a member but rest of the members disagreed on that
 now comes the important part in 1962 the indo-china war happened and the Arab Nations chose
to stay neutral instead of supporting us 
## six
Then during the Indo Pakistani war in 1965 and 1971 India was in a great need of support we badly needed an ally but
the Arab Nation chose to stand with Pakistan and we all know why but Israel despite not having any kind of
diplomatic relations with India at that time supported us and supplied with
all's Amun naans intelligence and training not just that Israel also helped India by providing secret informations 
for example in 1977 Israel gave an information to India about the Pakistani kahot uranium enrichment plan
and that saved us from a huge disaster but all this time the relationship
between Israel and India was more like a secret affair right from the beginning
India and abashedly supported Palestine and refused to have any sort of official
relations with Israel only in 1992 44 years after the formation of Israel
India finally established a complete diplomatic relations with Israel by
opening its Embassy in the city of deiv since then the two countries met eye to
## seven
eye on many occasions but even then India never ditch Palestine and firmly stood by them it has consistently supported the legitimate right of Palestine to have their own country India stands on the Israel Palestine
issue has always been in line with the United Nations resolutions in 199 9 the
Cargill War happened between India and Pakistan and that was a very crucial
time for us India openly asked for help and Israel came in support of us they
supplied us with arms and ammunitions and that played a significant role in
our Victory but even then India never ditched Palestine in 2008 to show its
support to Palestine India gifted a costly land in new delhi's elate area
for the construction of Palestinian Embassy fast forward to 2014 during the
Israel Gaza conflict India helped both the parties responsible for igniting
violence and asked Israel to stop the disproportionate use of for in Gaza
## eight
it may seem like India picked a side and supported Palestine over Israel but during the rajas SAA session a former external affairs minister sushma saraj
made it clear that India has friendly relation with both Israel and Palestine when the United Nations Human Rights Council report accusing Israel of war crimes was put out to vote five
countries refused to vote so gladly India was one of them since Prime
Minister Modi came to power India's relationship with Israel had been
stronger and Sounder in 2017 Narendra Modi became the first ever Indian Prime
Minister to visit Israel and he was welcomed by the Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin and they both went for the Beach Walk Prime Minister Modi visited
the war memorial Jewish Museum and signed multiple M with Israel but he did
not visit palistine then to add fuel to the fire Israeli Prime Minister visited
India in 2018 and flly kides with Prime Minister Modi but as usual India wants
to maintain its balance So within a month in February 2018 Prime Minister
Modi visited West Bank the Palestinian land and there he was awarded the title
of the grand caller of Palestine during this visit Prime Minister Modi made an
agreement to set up an India Palestine super Speciality Hospital in Palestine
for $0 million us 
## nine
and a new printing
press for $5 million us now coming to the current day scenario when Hamas
attacked Israel India stood with Israel and said Israel has all the rights to
defend itself and that was indeed a very bold step and when an hospital was
bombed in Kasa which killed around 500 people Prime Minister Modi is one of the few who voiced out immediately he tweeted deeply shocked at the tragic
loss of lives at the alh Hal Hospital in Gaza a heartfelt condolences to the
families of the victims and our prayers for speedy recovery of those injured
civilian casualties and the ongoing conflict are a matter of serious and
continuing concern those involved should be held responsible on one hand India
supports Israel's right to defend itself on the other hand it continues to send humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza why so why India refuses to take a stand at this crucial time why India
still wants to maintain its balance
between Israel and Palestine because
India is in a need to maintain good
relationship with Arab nations in the
G20 Summit that happened recently the
India middle Europe economic Corridor
project was signed and that hold a
significant geopolitical and economical
implications for India on the other hand
India still considers the attack on
Israel by Hamas to be terrorism which is
something India also has been facing
from Pakistan for a very long time so
India can somewhat relate with Israel on
top of everything Israel stood with
India in our tough times so it would be
fair to ditch them when they are in need
so what should India do I'm sure there
are enough experts to take care of this
but still we can't resist passing
opinions right so it's good for India to
maintain this neutral stance until the
conflict stays between the Israel and
Hamas apart from the political view we
should also look at the economic effects
on India even though there is not any
short-term effects due to the ongoing
War there are points which cannot be
ruled out it might affect India if the
situation was sense the Middle East is
one of the major oil suppliers to the
entire world if day-to-day life is
getting Disturbed in that region it's
going to lead to considerable spike in
oil prices and that's going to result in
high inflation in the society if the oil
price remain elevated the production
cost of almost all the products will get
rised and that's directly going to
affect the common people and there are
high chances that this conflict could
lead to the depreciation of Indian
rupees and let's not forget Israel is
one of the biggest exporter of military
equipments in India with the military
business between the two countries worth
around $2.1 billion and India is isra's
second largest trading partner in nation
IA and seventh largest globally in the
last 23 years India invested
$383 million Us in Israel on the other
hand Israel also directly invested $285
million us at the opposite side India's
trade with Saudi Arabia reached an
alltime high of $
52.75 million in the financial year 2023
## ten
now India is the second largest trading
partner of Saudi Arabia and let's not
forget India's trade with the Arab world
has already crossed an alltime high of
$240 billion a year 70% of our energy
Imports are coming from Arab countries
and 4.5 million Indians are living there
so India right now is in a very delicate
position so who should India stand with
it's not that easy to make a decision if
the situation worsens let's hope it's
not going to happen but still if the
situation worsens where other major
countries gang up against Israel I
personally think it's India's duty to
stand with Israel we owe them that they
firmly stood by us when we were in a
crisis so it would be our time to stand
with them when they are in a crisis so I
think standing with Israel would be
morally right for India but if the
situation was sense if you ever pushed
to pick a side no matter which side we
are picking it's going to affect us
economically if we stand by Palestine we
would lose our good ties with Israel and
they're not going to take it lightly
because they stood by us when we were in
need and they would obviously expect us
to do the same if we choose to support
Israel Over Palestine it's going to
affect other Arab Nations who strongly
support Palestine and that might mess up
our trading relationship with them Dr J
shanka recently said terrorism is
unacceptable but solution to the
Palestinian land is also a must I stand
by that now who do you think India
should support Israel or Palestine let
me know in the comments and if you find
